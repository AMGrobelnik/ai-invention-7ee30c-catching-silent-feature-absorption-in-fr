<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A research paper writer (Step 3.4: GEN_PAPER_TEXT in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, all artifacts, the previous paper draft (if any), and reviewer feedback.
Write a complete paper draft with figure placeholders.

Publication-quality paper → strong contribution. Weak paper → wasted iteration.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<research_methodology>
Write like a researcher drafting a paper, not a chatbot summarizing bullet points.

- Structure as a paper would: research question → methodology → results → analysis → limitations. Not a list of "we did X, then Y."
- Ground every claim in specific artifacts and specific numbers. "Results show improvement" is empty — state effect sizes, baselines, and conditions.
- Be honest about what worked, what didn't, and why. Don't spin failures as "future work."
- The paper's headline contribution should be a positive or surprising finding. Negative results are valuable context but should not be the primary narrative — lead with what works.
- Address reviewer feedback from previous iterations explicitly — show you've thought about each critique.
</research_methodology>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done

  Two-Track Interventional Co-Response Grouping of SAE Latents (Correlation for Splitting, Anchored Greedy Set-Cover for Absorption):
  Training-Free, Auditable Concept Units that Recover the Absorbers Marginal-Attribution Selection Drops on BOTH Spelling
  and a Non-Spelling Hierarchy, and Beat Raw Latents and Count-Matched Observational Clusters
hypothesis: |-
  ONE-SENTENCE HEADLINE (load-bearing, C1+C3): clustering frozen SAE latents by their INTERVENTIONAL co-response to content counterfactuals -- via a concretely specified TWO-TRACK algorithm (positive content-response CORRELATION for the splitting regime; an ANCHORED GREEDY SET-COVER for the absorption regime, because mutually-exclusive disjoint-support absorbers have LOW pairwise correlation and cannot be proposed by any affinity-merging clustering) -- yields training-free, human-auditable, multi-member concept units that (C1) beat the best raw single latent AND COUNT-MATCHED observational co-activation/decoder-geometry clusters on safety-attribute classification, and (C3, the spine) recover the absorber latents a count-matched marginal-attribution selection silently drops on BOTH the first-letter spelling hierarchy AND one non-spelling hierarchy (numeric-quantity or taxonomic-entity absorption), with knowledge-graph specialization edges that agree with the supervised absorption diagnostic (Chanin 2409.14507) -- the diagnostic used ONLY to score edges, never to form units, so the comparison is non-circular. SUPPORTING SECOND RESULT: the same absorber-recovery, viewed under sub-population reweighting, keeps worst-sub-context recall stable where a count-matched marginal-attribution pool collapses, approaching an oracle group-DRO probe that uses sub-context labels while the unit uses none. SUPPORTING THIRD RESULT (now MEASURED, not asserted): an auditability repair loop -- read the knowledge graph, find the absorber missing for an under-served sub-context, add it -- produces a quantifiable recall recovery that a retrained label-free reweighting probe structurally cannot expose.

  THE CLUSTERING ALGORITHM -- THE NAMED CONTRIBUTION, NOW SPECIFIED CONCRETELY (resolves the methodology major: the proposal step, not just the admission filter). Input: a frozen SAE (Gemma Scope L12 width-16k canonical) and, per concept, a set P of content-flip minimal pairs (x_off, x_on) (concept absent/present, surface matched) plus surface-flip pairs for the invariance check. The concept labels on P are the SAME counterfactual supervision every matched baseline (d)/(e)/(f)/(g)/(h) consumes -- the algorithm uses NO absorption-specific oracle.
    STEP 1 -- per-latent content-response feature. For each SAE latent l and each pair p: content-response r_l(p) = a_l(x_on) - a_l(x_off), where a_l = SAE encode activation (firing iff a_l>0). Build matrix R[L x |P|]. Record firing support F_l(p)=1[a_l(x_on)>0]. Keep only CONTENT-RESPONSIVE latents (mean r_l above the 95th-pct shuffled-pair null) -> candidate pool of a few hundred. Define each latent's COVER SET C_l = { p : r_l(p) > tau_resp AND a_l fires on x_on AND the latent's content-response PRECISION on its own firing support >= 0.7 } -- the pairs whose content flip this latent reliably and precisely tracks.
    STEP 2 -- C-TRACK (SPLITTING; symmetric pairwise affinity is APPROPRIATE here because split sub-latents share support and co-respond). Affinity A_C[l,l'] = positive part of the Spearman correlation between content-response profiles r_l and r_l' over P (DiffCoEx-style sign-aware soft-threshold). Build a graph (edge iff A_C above a stability-selected threshold) and run Leiden community detection -> splitting communities; community count fixed by modularity + bootstrap ARI stability vs the shuffled-pair null.
    STEP 3 -- K-TRACK (ABSORPTION; an ANCHORED GREEDY MAX-COVERAGE procedure, NOT a pairwise affinity, because disjoint-support absorbers cannot be merged by correlation). (i) ANCHOR = argmax_l |C_l| over content-responsive latents = the highest-RECALL 'general/parent' candidate, chosen using ONLY P (NOT the Chanin diagnostic; tie-break by broadest, lowest-entropy firing support). (ii) HOLES H = P \ C_anchor = the pairs the parent goes silent on -- exactly the absorbed sub-contexts. (iii) GREEDY COVER: while H is non-empty and improving, add l* = argmax_l |C_l intersect H| SUBJECT TO mutual exclusivity with all current members (pairwise firing Jaccard < 0.1), precision >= 0.7, and marginal coverage gain |C_l* intersect H|/|P| >= 0.05 with a bootstrap CI excluding 0 (the small-k effect-size floor); set H <- H \ C_l*. Output unit = {anchor, absorber_1, ...}: members are mutually exclusive in firing, individually precise, and JOINTLY cover the concept's content flips. By construction this surfaces {general 'starts-with-L' latent, 'lion'-absorber, 'London'-absorber}: the anchor has the holes, the greedy step fills them with the disjoint specialists -- which is precisely what correlation-merging clustering cannot do.
    STEP 4 -- RECONCILIATION into one output. For each C-community designate its highest-recall member as a candidate anchor and run STEP-3 K-augmentation to pull in mutually-exclusive absorbers covering that community's holes; also seed STEP 3 from standalone high-recall latents in no dense community. A final unit is therefore a pure C-community (splitting), a pure K-cover (absorption), or a hybrid (a split community augmented with absorbers). De-duplicate; assign each latent to its highest-coverage-gain unit. 'Complementary coverage' is thus defined ONLY relative to a concrete anchor's hole set -- never as a vague affinity between arbitrary disjoint latents.
    STEP 5 -- ADMISSION FILTER (unchanged, now clearly downstream of a proposal step that can actually generate K-units). Admit a unit iff it clears signature C (within-unit content-response correlation > 95th-pct shuffled-pair null) OR signature K (pooled-max content-response AUC minus best-single-member AUC > 95th pct of a best-of-random-k null MATCHED on marginal content-response AUC, PLUS at k in {2,3} the absolute >=0.05 gain floor with CI excluding 0, PLUS mutual-exclusivity Jaccard<0.1 and per-member precision>=0.7), AND unit-level surface invariance (pooled surface-response not above the shuffled-surface null). Report the cleared signature per concept and the false-admit rate under BOTH the all-latent and matched random-k nulls (target <=0.05).
    PILOT VALIDATION OF THE PROPOSAL STEP (Tier 0, NEVER dropped; the specific de-risk the reviewer demanded). BEFORE C3 relies on it, run STEP 3 on first-letter given ONLY content-flip pairs and check the proposed anchor+absorbers MATCH the parent+absorbers the Chanin 2409.14507 diagnostic identifies (membership precision/recall vs the diagnostic, above a random-membership null). If the proposal step cannot recover the worked unit at the pilot, the K-track is reported as failing at proposal time -- an honest, informative negative.

  MINIMUM VIABLE RESULT = THE LOAD-BEARING CORE (what still stands even if every robustness comparison ties and aggregate F1 ties the dense probe): (i) the Tier-0 pilot confirms above-null co-response structure AND that the K-proposal step recovers the known first-letter unit; (ii) C1 -- the unit beats the best raw latent AND COUNT-MATCHED observational co-activation/decoder-geometry clusters on classification; (iii) C3 -- on first-letter AND one non-spelling absorption hierarchy, the unit recovers absorber latents the supervised oracle's top-N marginal-attribution selection (g) and the count-matched pool (h) drop, wins on the differing sub-contexts, and its KG specialization edges agree with the (form-free) absorption diagnostic. C3 is measured against SAE-SELECTION baselines (a)/(g)/(h), NOT the dense-probe aggregate-F1 bar, so the central bet does NOT ride on out-classifying a strong dense probe.

  BASELINE GLOSSARY (one plain line each): (a) best raw single latent; (b) observational co-activation/feature-family clusters (grouped by what fires together) -- COUNT-MATCHED to the unit's member count for C1; (c) decoder-geometry clusters (grouped by decoder cosine) -- COUNT-MATCHED for C1; (d) counterfactually-matched diff-of-means; (e) counterfactually-matched linear probe; (f) surface-invariant matched probe = (d)/(e) with the surface direction LEACE-erased -- the conceded SINGLE dense hyperplane; (g) supervised oracle pool = top-N SAE latents by SCR/TPP attribution; (h) count-and-pool-matched probe = max-pool over EXACTLY #members raw residual directions chosen by the SAME SCR/TPP attribution as (g); (i) unmatched diff-of-means/probe on raw labels; (j) oracle group-DRO probe (true sub-context labels) = robustness UPPER BOUND; (k) label-free group-inference probe (JTT/GEORGE-style, no labels).

  HEADLINE RESULT GRID (LOAD-BEARING rows first):
  | Claim (role) | Compared against | Metric | Predicted sign | What it isolates |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | C1 (CORE) | (b)/(c) observational clusters CUT TO THE UNIT's k members | classification F1/AUC, IID + shift, AT MATCHED POOL SIZE | unit > matched (b)/(c) | co-response selects the RIGHT k members, not just more capacity |
  | C1 completeness | (a) best raw latent (1 direction) | F1/AUC | unit > (a) | near-foregone capacity win, reported for completeness only |
  | C3 ABSORBER-RECOVERY, first-letter (CORE, spine) | (g) oracle pool; (h) count-matched pool; diagnostic 2409.14507 | recovered-absorber count; recall on differing sub-contexts; KG-edge agreement | unit > (g)/(h); edges agree | co-response selection ADMITS the absorber marginal attribution DROPS |
  | C3 ABSORBER-RECOVERY, NON-SPELLING hierarchy (CORE, generality) | (g)/(h); form-free absorption diagnostic | recovered-absorber count; sliced recall; KG-edge agreement | unit > (g)/(h) IF absorption present; else honest scope-null | absorption is a general phenomenon, not a spelling artifact |
  | C2 (core-adjacent) | (g) oracle pool; (h) count+pool-matched | classification F1/AUC | unit >= both | gain is selection, not supervised ranking or pooling |
  | AUDITABILITY REPAIR (SUPPORTING, MEASURED) | random-latent-addition control; (k) opaque probe | recall recovery on a targeted under-served sub-context | KG-guided add > random add; (k) cannot localize | the KG buys a per-sub-context fix (k) structurally cannot |
  | SELECTION-CRITERION ordering, toxicity (SUPPORTING) | (f); (g)/(h) | worst-sub-context recall vs reweighting magnitude | (f) < (g)/(h) < unit; unit-(g)/(h) grows | co-response vs marginal-attribution SELECTION at matched pool size |
  | Robustness bounds, toxicity (SUPPORTING) | (j) oracle group-DRO; (k) label-free | worst-sub-context recall | unit approaches (j) w/o labels; unit >= (k) AND auditable | training-free auditable route vs loss-reweighting route |
  | Dense-probe aggregate F1 (CONCEDED) | (f) | aggregate F1 | tie acceptable | concedes the AxBench bar honestly |

  WHY C1 IS NOW COUNT-MATCHED (resolves the rigor minor). Beating the best raw single latent with a multi-member pooled unit is a near-foregone capacity win; we report it only for completeness. The LOAD-BEARING half of C1 is the unit beating observational clusters (b)/(c) AT MATCHED POOL SIZE -- we cut each observational cluster to the unit's exact member count k (top-k members by the same pooling rule) so any C1 win cannot be a capacity/pooling artifact and instead shows co-response SELECTS the right members where co-activation/geometry select the wrong ones (they cannot even propose the disjoint-support absorbers).

  THE SELECTION-CRITERION ISOLATION. The unit-vs-(g)/(h) comparison holds POOL SIZE FIXED -- all three pool the same number of directions -- and varies ONLY HOW members are chosen: co-response set-cover membership vs marginal SCR/TPP attribution ranking. Both pool, so what is isolated is the SELECTION/MEMBERSHIP CRITERION. The structural claim reduces to one sentence: CO-RESPONSE COVERAGE ADMITS THE ABSORBER THAT MARGINAL-ATTRIBUTION RANKING DROPS (low marginal attribution because it fires only in a narrow sub-context). Beating the single hyperplane (f) is conceded to be a pooling effect; the signal is exactly unit-minus-(g)/(h), the SAME quantity as C3 absorber-recovery. Pre-registered ORDERING on worst-sub-context recall: (f) < (g)/(h) < unit, with unit-minus-(g)/(h) GROWING in reweighting magnitude. HONEST NEGATIVE: if the unit ties (g)/(h), the contribution reduces cleanly to C3 absorber-recovery + measured auditability.

  THE TWO ABSORPTION TESTBEDS FOR THE C3 SPINE (resolves the scope major: absorption as a phenomenon, not one synthetic spelling task). TESTBED 1 -- FIRST-LETTER SPELLING (the documented, guaranteed-signal regime): 'starts-with-L' fragments into a general latent plus per-token absorbers ('lion'/'London'); oracle = Chanin 2409.14507 spelling diagnostic. TESTBED 2 -- ONE NON-SPELLING HIERARCHY, promoted into the NEVER-DROPPED Tier-1a core (a NUMERIC-QUANTITY hierarchy -- a general 'numeric token' latent with format absorbers for years/percentages/dates -- as primary, with a TAXONOMIC 'is-a-country' hierarchy as the pre-registered alternative if numeric absorption is too weak). Because absorption is empirically documented almost ONLY on spelling, Testbed 2 is ALSO a novel empirical test of whether the sparsity-plus-hierarchy mechanism produces absorption beyond spelling; we apply the FORM-FREE version of the Chanin diagnostic (train a linear probe for the parent concept; for each false-negative example find the latent whose ablation most shifts the concept logit) as the oracle. DUAL OUTCOME, both reportable: (POSITIVE) the K-proposal recovers a parent+absorbers in a genuinely semantic regime -> C3 generalizes, a significant result; (NULL) the parent latent has NO holes filled by mutually-exclusive specialists (a NON-TRIVIALITY pre-check on Testbed 2) -> we report that absorption is spelling-specific, scope the C3 title claim to spelling-type hierarchical absorption, and route cross-concept generality through C1 (which spans toxicity/sentiment/aspect). Either way the spine no longer rests on a single synthetic concept.

  THE TWO REGIME STORIES, KEPT SEPARATE. STORY 1 -- ABSORPTION (signature K, complementary coverage): first-letter AND the non-spelling hierarchy; headline = absorber recovery vs (g)/(h) + KG-edge agreement; the K-track set-cover is the proposing mechanism. STORY 2 -- SPLITTING (signature C, multi-sub-context): toxicity (slurs vs threats vs demeaning insults), each carried by positively co-responding latents; headline = worst-sub-context recall under sub-population reweighting (SUPPORTING); the C-track correlation community detection is the proposing mechanism.

  DEGENERATE-CONSTRUCTION GUARD (reweighting test not true-by-construction). Sub-contexts are defined from INDEPENDENT labels fixed before any comparison (civil_comments sub-attribute floats; CEBaB aspect levels) -- never from the unit's members; 'under-served' is determined on the dense probe (f) ALONE; the reweighting-magnitude axis is pre-registered; NON-TRIVIALITY CHECK: (f) genuinely collapses (recall drop above a pre-set threshold) on these independently-defined sub-contexts, else the test is void and reported as such.

  THE THREE NESTED CLAIMS. (A) 'Counterfactual supervision helps' (NOT ours): naive (i) -> matched probe (d)/(e). (B) 'Counterfactual-INVARIANCE helps' (conceded, non-SAE): matched probe -> surface-invariant (f) via LEACE (Belrose 2024). (C) 'CO-RESPONSE GROUPING helps' (THE contribution): C1 -- unit beats best raw latent and COUNT-MATCHED observational clusters; C2 -- unit matches/beats oracle pool (g) and count-matched pool (h); C3 -- the spine: recovers absorbers (g)/(h) drop on TWO hierarchies with KG-edge agreement.

  AUDITABILITY -- NOW A MEASURED RESULT, NOT AN ASSERTION (resolves the rigor minor and de-risks the all-ties branch). Always-run demo: (1) pick an under-served sub-context (recall hole on the dense probe (f)); (2) read the KG to identify the absorber member that covers that sub-context; (3) ADD it to the unit; (4) MEASURE recall on that sub-context before vs after, with a bootstrap CI on the gain, AGAINST a random-content-responsive-latent-addition control (isolating that the KG-guided choice, not mere capacity, drives the repair) AND showing (k) -- an opaque retrained probe -- exposes no per-sub-context member to add. (5) MEMBER-LABELING AGREEMENT: give an independent LLM judge each member's logit-lens tokens + top conditioning contexts and ask which sub-context it covers; agreement with the KG edge above a shuffled-label null operationalizes 'human-auditable' as a number. Auditability-repair + member-labeling agreement is the standalone measured deliverable when every robustness comparison ties.

  SINGLE ADMISSION RULE and A-PRIORI POWER/MDE are unchanged in spirit. PRIMARY statistical object = per-concept / within-family paired-bootstrap CIs; the cross-family number is DESCRIPTIVE only (between-cluster variance not estimable over ~3-4 clusters). For the central unit-minus-(g)/(h) worst-sub-context-recall gap we PRE-REGISTER a PAIRED bootstrap (B=10000) on per-example correctness differences with an EXACT McNemar confirmatory; primary reported quantity = the gap's SIGN and its SLOPE vs measured reweighting magnitude (bootstrap CI on the slope). A-PRIORI MDE (proportion, conservative unpaired): n ~= 7.84*[p1(1-p1)+p2(1-p2)]/Delta^2 -> ~91 positives for Delta=0.20, ~167 for 0.15, ~384 for 0.10; the paired design is strictly more powerful. PRE-REGISTER n_min=150 positive examples per tested under-served sub-context, STRATIFY collection to hit it; sub-contexts too rare to reach n_min are reported descriptively and excluded from the inferential test.

  ENGAGING THE LABEL-FREE GROUP-ROBUSTNESS LITERATURE. Competitors for the SUPPORTING result: JTT (2107.09044), GEORGE (2011.12945), EIIL (2010.07249), LfF (2007.02561), Diverse Prototypical Ensembles (2505.23027) -- they infer groups over EXAMPLES and RETRAIN. Our route groups FEATURES (discrete SAE latents) by interventional co-response, never retrains, and the recovered absorbers ARE the inferred sub-context specialists. Baselines (j) oracle group-DRO (upper bound) and (k) label-free group-inference. Prediction: the unit APPROACHES (j) WITHOUT labels and is competitive-or-better than (k) while uniquely auditable; if (k) strictly wins on recall, that is an honest negative (loss-reweighting wins for pure robustness; the unit still delivers the auditable, measured repair).

  HEADLINE SCOPE with honest effective-n. Headline spans ~3 GENUINELY INDEPENDENT concept families: (1) TOXICITY (civil_comments/ParaDetox), 5 sub-attributes, best-powered, hosts the reweighting test; (2) SENTIMENT (Kaushik 2020 CAD-IMDB); (3) RESTAURANT ASPECT-SENTIMENT (CEBaB, food+service nested as ONE family). A 4th out-of-domain axis is a drop-first stretch. Per-family bootstrap CIs PRIMARY; cross-family DESCRIPTIVE. first-letter spelling AND the non-spelling hierarchy = the controlled ABSORPTION mechanism testbeds (outside the family count); bias_in_bios = a pre-registered BOUNDARY-NULL. A clean null at any stage is a publishable mechanism-level finding.
motivation: |-
  Single SAE latents are unreliable units of analysis. Feature absorption (a specific child latent suppresses a more general parent's firing, leaving the parent with unpredictable holes; Chanin 2409.14507 [NeurIPS 2025], 2505.11756), feature splitting (one concept fragments across many latents), feature hedging (a narrow SAE merges correlated features into one polysemantic latent), and 'SAEs Do Not Find Canonical Units of Analysis' (ICLR 2025, 2502.04878) converge on one conclusion: no single latent reliably tracks a concept. AxBench (ICML 2025 spotlight, 2501.17148) and DeepMind's negative-results report make the stakes concrete -- plain difference-of-means beats raw-latent SAE methods -- so any SAE-grouping method must clear strong simple baselines.

  WHY THE LOAD-BEARING CLAIM IS C1+C3, AND WHY THE ALGORITHM HAD TO BE SPECIFIED. The single most defensible deliverable is absorber recovery (C3): the co-response unit admits the absorber latents the supervised oracle's top-N marginal-attribution selection (g) and the count-matched pool (h) drop, with KG edges agreeing with the absorption diagnostic. But absorbers are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE in firing with their parent and respond on DISJOINT supports, so they have LOW pairwise content-response correlation -- meaning a correlation/affinity-merging clustering can never even PROPOSE the right group, and an admission rule that only FILTERS candidates cannot rescue a unit the proposal step never generated. This is why the contribution is now a TWO-TRACK algorithm: a correlation-community track for splitting (where support is shared) and a separate ANCHORED GREEDY SET-COVER track for absorption (anchor on the highest-recall parent candidate, greedily add mutually-exclusive latents that cover its holes). Maximum-coverage greedy selection is the natural, classic instrument for 'cover a set with complementary specialists' -- and it is exactly the instrument the absorption regime demands, because coverage-complementarity is a set-level property, not a pairwise affinity. The anchor is chosen WITHOUT the absorption diagnostic (by content-response recall, available to every baseline), so 'the unsupervised unit beats the supervised oracle' is not undercut and the KG-edge validation against the diagnostic is non-circular (the diagnostic scores edges, never forms them).

  The contribution lives squarely in clustering / feature-selection / classification for a learned knowledge representation (SAE features): cluster-level units plus a feature-level knowledge graph, evaluated on downstream classification (headline) with steering and model-diffing as generality demonstrations. Every existing POST-HOC grouping method relies on OBSERVATIONAL signals -- which latents fire together (co-activation feature families) or which decoders point alike (geometry). But absorption is exactly the regime where observational signals break BY CONSTRUCTION: the parent and absorbing child are mutually exclusive in firing, so co-activation clustering provably cannot group them and their decoders need not be cosine-similar. The standard SUPERVISED remedy -- select top-N latents by causal effect on a concept probe (SCR/TPP, Karvonen 2411.18895, built on Marks SHIFT) -- SILENTLY DROPS absorbed latents, because a latent firing only in a narrow sub-context has low MARGINAL attribution even though it carries the concept there.

  ABSORPTION BEYOND SPELLING IS UNDER-TESTED -- AND THAT IS AN OPPORTUNITY. The literature documents absorption empirically almost entirely on first-letter spelling; the sparsity-plus-hierarchy MECHANISM, however, predicts absorption in any token-level hierarchy (numeric formats, taxonomic entities). Promoting one non-spelling hierarchy into the load-bearing core therefore does double duty: it moves C3 from 'one synthetic spelling task' to 'absorption as a phenomenon', and it is itself a novel empirical test of whether absorption generalizes -- with the form-free probe-plus-ablation diagnostic (domain-agnostic) as oracle and an explicit honest-null fallback (absorption is spelling-specific -> scope C3, route generality through C1) if the non-spelling parent has no specialist-filled holes.

  RECENT ARCHITECTURAL REMEDIES ARE ORTHOGONAL (and confirm the gap). Subspace-Aware SAEs (SASA, 2606.06333), Matryoshka SAEs, Concept-Bottleneck SAEs (CVPR 2026), AbsTopK and Group SAEs all RETRAIN the SAE to reduce splitting/absorption at training time. We do the opposite: a TRAINING-FREE, POST-HOC repair of FROZEN public SAEs (Gemma Scope), exactly as the goal requires. No retraining method produces a human-auditable multi-member unit over an existing public SAE, which is what practitioners actually have.

  TWO cross-field transfers motivate the method. (1) Systems biology faced the identical grouping obstacle: co-regulated genes are often NOT co-expressed at baseline and reveal shared regulation only under perturbation, which is why differential co-expression methods (DiffCoEx, WGCNA) cluster genes by CORRELATED RESPONSE TO A PERTURBATION rather than baseline co-expression -- the root of our C-track (genes->latents, perturbation->content counterfactual). (2) Combinatorial optimization supplies the absorption-regime instrument: the disjoint-support 'cover the concept with complementary specialists' problem is a MAXIMUM-COVERAGE / SET-COVER problem, whose greedy (1-1/e) solution is the natural proposer for K-units -- a Level-3 methodological import never applied to SAE-latent grouping. Distributionally-robust learning (group-DRO; Mind-the-GAP 2403.09869) explains WHY the recovered unit generalizes: an absorber is a dedicated detector for one sub-context, so a complementary-coverage unit is implicitly a GROUP-OF-SPECIALISTS robust to mixing-weight shift where a single ERM hyperplane collapses -- but the SAME mechanism predicts a count-matched marginal-attribution pool is also robust, so beating one hyperplane is pooling; isolating CO-RESPONSE SELECTION means beating the count-matched pool that drops the very absorber the under-served sub-context needs.

  The insight an interpretability expert would not reach for: SAE absorption/splitting are structurally the same obstacle that (a) defeats baseline co-expression in biology and (b) makes ERM probes brittle under subpopulation shift -- so observational co-activation/geometry AND marginal-attribution selection are the wrong instruments; interventional co-response is the matched instrument, correlation is the right grouping operator only for the shared-support splitting case, and maximum-coverage set-cover is the right operator for the disjoint-support absorption case. If correct, this turns off-the-shelf public SAEs into reliable, auditable concept units with a measurable recall recovery on absorbed sub-contexts -- across spelling AND at least one semantic hierarchy. If incorrect, the honest negatives are actionable: the K-proposal step fails at the pilot (set-cover cannot surface the right group); observational co-response equals interventional co-response (no gain from intervention); the unit ties (g)/(h) (robustness is pooling; contribution reduces to absorber-recovery + measured auditability); absorption is spelling-specific (scope C3); or SAE units should be abandoned for dense surface-invariant probes.
assumptions:
- >-
  THE TWO-TRACK CLUSTERING ALGORITHM CAN PROPOSE THE RIGHT UNITS AT PROPOSAL TIME, NOT JUST FILTER THEM. Splitting families
  (shared support, positive co-response correlation) are proposable by C-track correlation-community detection; absorption
  units (disjoint support, mutually exclusive firing) are proposable ONLY by the K-track anchored greedy max-coverage, because
  their members have low pairwise correlation. The K-anchor is selected by content-response RECALL using only the counterfactual
  pairs every baseline shares -- NOT by the Chanin absorption diagnostic -- so 'unsupervised unit beats supervised oracle'
  holds and KG-edge validation against that diagnostic is non-circular. We pre-register a Tier-0 PILOT proving the K-proposal
  recovers the worked 'starts-with-L' parent+absorbers (membership precision/recall vs the diagnostic, above a random-membership
  null) BEFORE C3 relies on it; if the proposal step fails there, the K-track is reported as failing at proposal time.
- >-
  MINIMAL PAIRS ARE OBTAINABLE AT HIGH QUALITY, LOW COST, AND NON-CIRCULARLY, FOR BOTH ABSORPTION HIERARCHIES AND THE SPLITTING
  FAMILIES. Content-flips use HUMAN-WRITTEN parallel corpora where available (ParaDetox toxic<->neutral; Kaushik 2020 CAD-IMDB
  sentiment; CEBaB human aspect edits) and templated/LLM-generated pairs (OpenRouter, well under $10, LLM-judge-scored for
  content-flipped + surface-preserved with reported pass rates) for first-letter substitutions and the non-spelling hierarchy
  (numeric-quantity formats or taxonomic entities). Any activation-space content edit, if used, is derived from an INDEPENDENT
  held-out diff-of-means on DISJOINT data, never from the SAE latents being grouped, so there is no circularity.

  THE C3 SPINE IS DEMONSTRATED ON ABSORPTION AS A PHENOMENON (TWO HIERARCHIES), NOT ONE SYNTHETIC TASK, WITH A HONEST-NULL
  FALLBACK. First-letter spelling is the documented, guaranteed-signal regime; one NON-SPELLING hierarchy (numeric-quantity
  formats primary, taxonomic 'is-a-country' alternative) is promoted into the NEVER-DROPPED Tier-1a core, scored by the FORM-FREE
  probe-plus-ablation absorption diagnostic. A NON-TRIVIALITY pre-check tests whether the non-spelling parent latent actually
  has specialist-filled holes; if it does not, we report that absorption is spelling-specific, scope the C3 title claim to
  spelling-type hierarchical absorption, and route cross-concept generality through C1 (toxicity/sentiment/aspect) -- the
  load-bearing core is unaffected either way.
- >-
  THE WIN, IF IT OCCURS, IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CO-RESPONSE SELECTION AT MATCHED POOL SIZE -- NOT TO SUPERVISION, CAPACITY, OR
  MERE POOLING. C1 count-matches observational clusters (b)/(c) to the unit's exact member count (so beating them is not a
  capacity artifact; beating the single best latent (a) is a near-foregone capacity win reported only for completeness). (f)
  is information-matched via LEACE; (g) controls label selection; (h) max-pools EXACTLY #members SCR/TPP-selected raw directions,
  holding pool SIZE fixed so the ONLY varying factor is the membership/SELECTION criterion (co-response coverage vs marginal
  attribution). The pre-registered ORDERING (f) < (g)/(h) < unit on worst-sub-context recall isolates selection; beating (f)
  is conceded as pooling; beating (g)/(h) is the signal and equals C3 absorber-recovery.

  AUDITABILITY IS MEASURED, AND THE RUN FITS A SINGLE GPU WITHIN BUDGET. Off-the-shelf Gemma Scope SAEs on Gemma-2-2b expose
  latent counterfactual responses above noise on a single GPU for a few thousand minimal pairs per concept; chosen attributes
  have enough labeled/templatable data; paired base (pt) and instruction-tuned (it) Gemma Scope SAEs are available for model-diffing.
  The auditability claim is operationalized as a MEASURED repair loop (KG-guided absorber addition -> recall recovery on a
  targeted sub-context vs a random-addition control, with bootstrap CI) plus an LLM-judge member-labeling agreement metric
  against a shuffled-label null. Absorption is more severe at WIDER SAEs and splitting at larger width, so width/layer is
  a robustness axis (16k canonical primary; 65k drop-first). The load-bearing core fits the hard per-tier GPU-hour budgets
  below.
investigation_approach: |-
  DEPTH-FIRST EXECUTION ORDER WITH HARD PER-TIER BUDGETS AND A PRE-REGISTERED DROP ORDER. Single GPU; executor wall-clock ~6 h. The run is triaged so a clean LOAD-BEARING CORE is always produced.

  TIER 0 -- DE-RISKING PILOT INCLUDING THE PROPOSAL-STEP CHECK (<= 1.0 GPU-h, NEVER dropped). (ARM A, absorption, first-letter) build content-flip pairs; run the K-track STEP-3 set-cover given ONLY the pairs and verify the proposed anchor+absorbers MATCH the Chanin 2409.14507 diagnostic's parent+absorbers (membership precision/recall above a random-membership null) -- this proves the algorithm can PROPOSE K-units before C3 relies on it; also measure complementary coverage (pooled max tracks the flip where members have holes) vs the shuffled-pair null. (ARM B, splitting, toxicity) on ParaDetox/civil_comments measure how many latents carry toxicity, whether content-response profiles are positively correlated above null, and whether the C-track community + pooled unit beats the single best latent and the matched diff-of-means on a held-out IID slice. (ARM C, NON-SPELLING absorption non-triviality) on the chosen numeric/taxonomic hierarchy, test whether a high-recall parent latent exists AND has specialist-filled holes; a clean absence is reported as 'absorption is spelling-specific'. Proceed with a regime as headline only if its pilot clears the null.

  TIER 1a -- LOAD-BEARING CORE (<= 2.75 GPU-h, NEVER dropped). (1) C1: the co-response unit beats the best raw latent (a) AND COUNT-MATCHED observational co-activation/geometry clusters (b)/(c) on classification, on first-letter (absorption) AND the best-powered toxicity family; the matched (b)/(c) comparison is foregrounded as load-bearing. (2) C3 (the spine): on first-letter AND the non-spelling hierarchy, recovered-absorber count vs the oracle pool (g) and count-matched pool (h); sliced recall on the differing sub-contexts; KG specialization-edge agreement with the (form-free) absorption diagnostic. (3) the SELECTION-CRITERION ordering (f) < (g)/(h) < unit on worst-sub-context recall on the best-powered toxicity family, with the PAIRED-bootstrap per-pair gap and its slope-vs-reweighting as the primary inferential object. (4) the degenerate-construction guard and non-triviality check on (f). HARD CHECKPOINT: if the core has not cleared, STOP expanding and write up the core + honest negatives.

  ALWAYS-RUN MINIMAL GENERALITY + AUDITABILITY DEMOS (<= 0.75 GPU-h, NEVER dropped). (i) ONE null-floored STEERING result (toxicity unit direction vs best single latent vs matched diff-of-means: on-target effect + KL on unrelated prompts, above a shuffle null). (ii) ONE null-floored MODEL-DIFFING result (does the unit detect a base-vs-it concept-usage shift more reliably than the best single latent, above a shuffle null, using paired pt/it Gemma Scope SAEs?). (iii) THE MEASURED AUDITABILITY REPAIR LOOP: pick an under-served sub-context (recall hole on (f)); read the KG to find the absorber member covering it; ADD it; MEASURE recall recovery on that sub-context (bootstrap CI) AGAINST a random-content-responsive-latent-addition control, and confirm (k) exposes no per-sub-context member to add; PLUS an LLM-judge member-labeling agreement metric (predict each member's sub-context from its logit-lens tokens + conditioning contexts) vs a shuffled-label null. All three are stated as GENERALITY/AUDITABILITY DEMONSTRATIONS, not load-bearing.

  TIER 1b -- SUPPORTING (<= 1.5 GPU-h, demotable). Sentiment (CAD-IMDB) family; shift-decomposition conditions (i) surface-only + (ii) reweighting; the label-free group-inference probe (k) and oracle group-DRO probe (j); cluster-stability bootstraps (adjusted Rand / Jaccard vs null); per-family CIs.

  TIER 2 -- STRETCH (only if Tier 1a+1b land with budget left). CEBaB restaurant aspect-sentiment family; ONE DECISIVELY-executed steering case (matched on-target effect, KL on unrelated prompts + fluency, bootstrap CIs, engaging 2505.20063/AxBench); shift condition (iii) natural domain shift; a fuller model-diffing check; the SECOND non-spelling absorption hierarchy (taxonomic if numeric was primary, or vice versa).

  PRE-REGISTERED DROP ORDER (first dropped first): 4th out-of-domain axis -> CEBaB family -> shift condition (iii) -> oracle/label-free probes (j)/(k) -> sentiment family -> decisive Tier-2 steering (keep the minimal one) -> fuller model-diffing (keep the minimal one) -> second non-spelling hierarchy. NEVER dropped: Tier-0 pilot (incl. proposal-step check + non-triviality), Tier-1a core (incl. the FIRST non-spelling absorption hierarchy), the three minimal generality+auditability demos.

  COUNTERFACTUAL SIGNAL. Encode every text and its counterfactual with a frozen Gemma Scope residual-stream SAE (layer ~12, width 16k canonical). Per latent: content-response = delta(activation) under content-flip; surface-response = delta under surface-flip; aggregate into per-latent response profiles and cover sets across contexts.

  CLUSTERING METHOD (the in-scope contribution, specified above as STEPS 1-5 + pilot). C-TRACK: positive content-response correlation affinity (DiffCoEx-style) -> Leiden communities for splitting. K-TRACK: anchored greedy maximum-coverage over content-response cover sets for absorption (anchor = highest-recall content-responsive latent chosen WITHOUT the absorption diagnostic; greedily add mutually-exclusive, precise latents covering the anchor's holes until marginal coverage gain < 0.05 with CI excluding 0). RECONCILE C-communities and K-covers (anchor each community, augment with absorbers; seed K from standalone high-recall latents) into one de-duplicated output. Finalize each candidate unit with the SINGLE ADMISSION RULE (signature C OR matched-null signature K + small-k effect-size floor + mutual-exclusivity + precision floor, AND unit-level surface invariance); report the cleared signature per concept and the false-admit rate under both nulls. Emit human-auditable unit definitions (member latents, logit-lens tokens, conditioning contexts) and directed specialization edges (a member responsive only in a sub-context = absorbed/split child) = a feature-level knowledge graph.

  WORKED EXAMPLES. Toxicity unit (splitting, C-track): members = {profanity/slur latent, demeaning-insult latent, aggressive-imperative latent}; under ParaDetox detox all three drop together (signature C); pooled max tracks toxicity; pooled surface-response to paraphrase ~ 0. First-letter unit (absorption, K-track): anchor = general 'starts-with-L' latent (silent on 'lion'/'London'); greedy adds 'lion'-absorber then 'London'-absorber (each fires only in its sub-context, Jaccard ~ 0 with the anchor); pooled max covers 'starts-with-L' everywhere (signature K); pooled surface-response ~ 0. Numeric unit (non-spelling absorption, K-track): anchor = general 'numeric token' latent (holes on years/percentages); greedy adds a 4-digit-year absorber and a percentage absorber.

  BASELINES (matched baselines are primary). (a)-(k) as in the glossary; (b)/(c) COUNT-MATCHED to the unit for C1; (h) count-and-pool-matched for the selection-criterion isolation; (j)/(k) for the robustness bounds.

  EVAL -- LOAD-BEARING BACKBONE (reported regardless of dense-probe competitiveness): (1) co-response units have low Jaccard with co-activation/geometry clusters above the stability/shuffled-pair null; (2) units win specifically on the differing members -- sliced RECALL on the sub-contexts where the best latent / count-matched observational clusters / the oracle pool (g) / the count-matched pool (h) have holes, including absorbers (g)/(h) drop, on BOTH absorption hierarchies; (3) KG specialization edges agree with the form-free absorption diagnostic. EVAL -- CLASSIFICATION + SUPPORTING ROBUSTNESS: unit-pooled activation (max/sum over members) as classifier on IID and under the decomposed shifts; report F1/AUC AND worst-sub-context recall; the SELECTION-CRITERION prediction is the ORDERING (f) < (g)/(h) < unit with the unit-minus-(g)/(h) PAIRED gap GROWING in reweighting magnitude (slope CI primary). Robustness BOUNDS: unit approaches (j) without labels and is competitive-or-better than (k) while auditable. EVAL -- MEASURED AUDITABILITY: KG-guided absorber-addition recall recovery vs random-addition control (bootstrap CI); LLM-judge member-labeling agreement vs shuffled-label null. DEGENERATE-CONSTRUCTION GUARD applied throughout. STATISTICS: per-family paired-bootstrap CIs PRIMARY; cross-family aggregate DESCRIPTIVE; a-priori n_min=150 with stratified collection; cluster-stability bootstrap (adjusted Rand / Jaccard) vs shuffled-pair null.

  STEERING (Tier 2, ONE decisive case; minimal version always runs) and MODEL-DIFFING (minimal always runs; fuller Tier 2) as before -- generality demonstrations, not load-bearing, each null-floored.

  HONEST FAILURE-MODE REPORTING. The K-proposal set-cover failing to recover the worked unit at the pilot (proposal-step failure); the non-spelling parent having no specialist-filled holes (absorption spelling-specific -> scope C3); dependence on counterfactual quality (pass rates); concepts with no surface-invariant co-responding/complementary group; regimes where co-response collapses to co-activation (no gain over observational); the unit tying the count-matched pools (g)/(h) on sliced recall (robustness is pooling -> contribution reduces to absorber-recovery + measured auditability); the label-free group-inference probe (k) beating the unit on recall (loss-reweighting wins for pure robustness); the dense surface-invariant probe matching the unit on sliced recall (invariance supervision suffices; grouping adds only auditability); the oracle pool (g) tying the unit (selection not co-response structure); the reweighting test void because (f) does not collapse; the KG-guided repair not beating random-addition (auditability buys no fix); co-response too noisy to cluster (ARI ~ null); compute/SAE-width sensitivity; bias_in_bios boundary-null.
success_criteria: |-
  CONFIRMED if, pre-registered in this nesting (LOAD-BEARING CORE first):
  LOAD-BEARING (the paper stands on these alone, even if every robustness comparison ties and aggregate F1 ties the dense probe): (1) the Tier-0 pilot confirms above-null co-response structure AND the K-track PROPOSAL step recovers the known first-letter parent+absorbers (membership precision/recall above a random-membership null), with the toxicity arm also showing a pooled IID edge over the best single latent and the matched diff-of-means; (2) C1 -- the unit beats the best raw single latent AND COUNT-MATCHED observational co-activation/geometry clusters on classification on first-letter AND the best-powered toxicity family (matched-(b)/(c) per-family bootstrap CI excludes 0); the single-best-latent comparison is reported only for completeness; (3) C3 (the spine) -- on first-letter AND at least one NON-SPELLING absorption hierarchy the unit recovers absorber latents the oracle pool (g) and count-matched pool (h) drop, wins on the differing sub-contexts (paired-bootstrap gap CI excludes 0, sized to n_min=150), and its KG specialization edges agree with the (form-free) absorption diagnostic (2409.14507).
  SUPPORTING (strengthen the paper; honest nulls here do not sink it): (4) C2 + SELECTION-CRITERION ISOLATION -- the unit matches-or-beats (g) and (h) on classification AND shows the ORDERING (f) < (g)/(h) < unit on worst-sub-context recall, with a POSITIVE unit-minus-(g)/(h) PAIRED gap whose slope-vs-reweighting-magnitude CI excludes 0 (the unit-minus-(f) gap alone is conceded as pooling); (5) ROBUSTNESS BOUNDS -- the unit APPROACHES the oracle group-DRO probe (j) WITHOUT labels and is competitive-or-better than the label-free group-inference probe (k) while uniquely auditable; aggregate F1 vs (f) may tie; (6) MEASURED AUDITABILITY -- the KG-guided absorber-addition repair recovers recall on the targeted under-served sub-context with a bootstrap-CI gain over a random-content-responsive-latent-addition control, (k) cannot localize the fix, and LLM-judge member-labeling agreement exceeds a shuffled-label null; (7) ADMISSION + CONSTRUCTION INTEGRITY -- false-admit rate <= 0.05 under BOTH nulls; cluster assignments stable across bootstrap resamples (adjusted Rand/Jaccard above null); sub-contexts defined from independent labels frozen first, under-served determined on (f) alone, non-triviality check confirms (f) genuinely collapses; per-family CIs PRIMARY, cross-family DESCRIPTIVE.
  GENERALITY (always produced via the truncation fallback, never load-bearing): one null-floored steering result and one null-floored model-diffing result; the decisive Tier-2 steering case is confirmatory if it lands.
  HONEST NEGATIVES, each publishable: the K-track proposal step fails to recover the worked unit at the pilot (set-cover cannot surface disjoint-support absorbers); the non-spelling parent has no specialist-filled holes so absorption is spelling-specific (C3 scoped to spelling-type absorption, generality routed through C1); co-response grouping ties observational grouping (no gain from intervention); the unit ties (g)/(h) on sliced recall (robustness is pooling -> contribution reduces to absorber-recovery + measured auditability); (k) beats the unit on recall (loss-reweighting wins for pure robustness, unit still delivers the measured auditable repair); the dense surface-invariant probe matches the unit on sliced recall (grouping then contributes only auditability + the knowledge graph); the oracle pool (g) ties the unit (selection not co-response structure); the gap does NOT concentrate on the reweighting component or (f) does not collapse (supporting mechanism falsified/void, core unaffected); the KG-guided repair does not beat random-addition (auditability buys no measurable fix); co-response too noisy to cluster (ARI ~ null). bias_in_bios is a pre-registered boundary-null, not method failure.

  Maximum-coverage / set-cover and the greedy (1-1/e) algorithm (Nemhauser, Wolsey, Fisher 1978; Feige 1998): the classic
  combinatorial-optimization instrument for selecting a small set of complementary subsets that jointly cover a universe.
  We transfer it as the K-TRACK PROPOSER: anchor on a parent latent, then greedily add mutually-exclusive latents whose content-response
  cover sets fill the anchor's holes. To our knowledge maximum-coverage has never been used to GROUP SAE latents -- and it
  is exactly the operator the disjoint-support absorption regime needs, where pairwise-affinity clustering provably cannot
  propose the right group.

  Differential co-expression / perturbation co-response module discovery (DiffCoEx, BMC Bioinformatics 2010; WGCNA): cluster
  genes by their CORRELATED RESPONSE TO A PERTURBATION rather than baseline co-expression, because co-regulated genes are
  often not co-expressed at baseline. This is the root of our C-TRACK (correlation-community detection on content-response
  profiles for the splitting regime); to our knowledge never applied to SAE/LLM features. Our novel claim is that the same
  baseline-vs-perturbation distinction explains and repairs SAE splitting, AND that the disjoint-support absorption case needs
  a SEPARATE set-cover operator, not correlation.

  A is for Absorption (Chanin et al., 2409.14507, NeurIPS 2025): a SUPERVISED DIAGNOSTIC -- identify the parent latent by
  max encoder-cosine with an LR probe, find the absorbing latent by ablation on the relevant logit. It DETECTS absorption
  on individual latents and demonstrates it empirically almost only on first-letter spelling (running non-spelling example:
  'short'/'starts-with-S'); it does not GROUP parent+absorbers into a usable unit, nor test absorption in semantic hierarchies.
  We use the FORM-FREE version (probe + ablation, domain-agnostic) ONLY to SCORE our already-formed unit's KG edges (never
  to form units, so non-circular), as a partial oracle for the pilot, and we add a novel empirical test of whether absorption
  generalizes to a non-spelling (numeric/taxonomic) hierarchy.

  Feature Hedging: Correlated Features Break Narrow SAEs (Chanin, Dulka, Garriga-Alonso, 2505.11756): ABSORPTION learns gerrymandered
  latents (worse at WIDER SAEs, parent->child hierarchy, mutually-exclusive firing) vs HEDGING merges correlated features
  into a SINGLE polysemantic latent (worse at NARROWER SAEs). We scope grouping to splitting+absorption (a hedged single latent
  is not groupable) and treat correlation/hierarchy as the mechanistic cause our interventional probe exposes -- correlation
  for shared-support splitting, set-cover for disjoint-support absorption.
- >-
  AxBench (Wu et al., ICML 2025 spotlight, 2501.17148) and Negative Results for SAEs on Downstream Tasks (DeepMind 2025):
  difference-in-means is the strongest concept-detection method and raw-latent SAEs are not competitive; this sets the dense-probe
  bar. We deliberately do NOT stake the load-bearing claim on beating it: C3 absorber-recovery is measured against SAE-SELECTION
  baselines (a)/(g)/(h), and aggregate-F1 parity with the surface-invariant dense probe (f) is pre-registered as acceptable.

  Sparse Autoencoders Do Not Find Canonical Units of Analysis (Bussmann et al., ICLR 2025, 2502.04878): uses SAE stitching
  and meta-SAEs to argue SAEs do not learn canonical units; its remedy is geometric/training-based. We propose a BEHAVIORAL
  unit defined by counterfactual co-response (correlation OR set-cover) and unit-level surface invariance, evaluated on downstream
  classification + steering + model-diffing, with no retraining.

  grouping losses -- to reduce absorption/splitting at training time. Our grouping is POST-HOC over a FROZEN public SAE's
  discrete latents, defined by interventional co-response, requiring no retraining and yielding an auditable feature-level
  knowledge graph.

  SHIFT / SCR / TPP SAE evaluation (Marks et al. 2024; Karvonen et al. 2411.18895): SELECT individual SAE latents by ranking
  causal effect on a concept probe (top-N), then ablate the set; they do NOT cluster latents by interventional co-response.
  This is exactly our supervised ORACLE-POOL baseline (g) and, count-matched, the pool (h); a latent firing only in a narrow
  sub-context (an absorber) has low marginal attribution and is silently dropped -- the specific gap our co-response set-cover
  fills, and the quantity the unit-minus-(g)/(h) sliced-recall gap measures.

  Co-activation feature families and graph-regularized SAEs (Disentangling Dense Embeddings 2408.00657; GSAE; Sparse Feature
  Coactivation 2506.18141): group SAE features by OBSERVATIONAL co-activation/geometry. By construction these cannot group
  a concept's absorbed/split latents (mutually exclusive in firing); for C1 we COUNT-MATCH them to the unit's member count
  so a unit win cannot be a capacity artifact. We use the opposite, INTERVENTIONAL signal and demonstrate the structural blind
  spot via low-Jaccard + sliced-recall wins.

  JTT (2107.09044), GEORGE / No Subclass Left Behind (2011.12945), EIIL (2010.07249), LfF (2007.02561): the label-free worst-group-robustness
  family -- infer GROUPS OVER EXAMPLES and RETRAIN with reweighted / group-DRO loss. Our route is orthogonal: we group FEATURES
  (discrete SAE latents) by interventional co-response, never retrain, and the recovered absorbers ARE the inferred sub-context
  specialists -- auditable. We add an oracle group-DRO probe (j, true sub-context labels = upper bound) and a label-free group-inference

  Diverse Prototypical Ensembles (2505.23027): trains an ensemble of N diverse prototypes per class on FROZEN DENSE features

  for subpopulation shift', but it TRAINS learnable prototype vectors on dense representations; we group pre-existing DISCRETE
  SAE latents by interventional co-response with no training, yielding auditable concept atoms (not opaque prototypes) and
  a feature-level knowledge graph.

  Group-DRO and subpopulation-shift robustness (Sagawa et al.; Mind the GAP: Group-Aware Priors, 2403.09869): a single ERM

  We do NOT propose a new DRO method or theorem; we BORROW this as the a-priori mechanism explaining why a group-of-specialists
  unit out-generalizes a single hyperplane -- and use the SAME mechanism to predict a count-matched marginal-attribution pool
  is also robust, which is why selection is isolated against THAT pool, not the hyperplane.

  Discovering Concept Directions from Diffusion-based Counterfactuals via Latent Clustering (CDLC, 2505.07073; Pattern Recognition

  (one continuous direction per class in a diffusion latent space). We cluster DISCRETE SAE dictionary latents on a frozen
  LLM by their co-response PROFILES into auditable MULTI-MEMBER units, with a SET-COVER track for the absorption regime CDLC

  Domain-Filtered Knowledge Graphs from SAE Features (2604.23829): builds an internal knowledge graph from SAE features via

  (absorbed/split children) invisible to observational co-occurrence -- and we MEASURE its utility via the auditability repair
  loop.
inspiration: >-
  A triple cross-field transfer, now with the named algorithm specified track-by-track. The SPLITTING-regime grouping (C-track)
  is a Level-3 methodological import from systems biology's differential co-expression / perturbation co-response module discovery
  (DiffCoEx, WGCNA): cluster units by CORRELATED RESPONSE TO A PERTURBATION, not baseline co-expression, because co-regulated
  genes are frequently not co-expressed until perturbed (genes->SAE latents, perturbation->content counterfactual). The crucial
  reviewer-prompted addition: correlation cannot group the ABSORPTION regime, because absorbers are mutually exclusive in
  firing and respond on disjoint supports -- so the K-track imports a SECOND, distinct instrument from combinatorial optimization,
  the MAXIMUM-COVERAGE / SET-COVER greedy (Nemhauser-Wolsey-Fisher; Feige): anchor on the highest-recall parent latent, then
  greedily add complementary specialists that cover its holes. The SUPPORTING robustness mechanism is a Level-1/2 import from
  distributionally-robust learning (group-DRO; Mind-the-GAP 2403.09869) and the label-free worst-group-robustness subfield
  (JTT, GEORGE, EIIL, LfF, Diverse Prototypical Ensembles): a single ERM hyperplane collapses on under-served minority subgroups
  under mixing-weight shift, whereas a union of specialists is robust -- and an absorber is precisely a specialist for one
  latent sub-context; because the SAME mechanism predicts a count-matched marginal-attribution pool is also robust, isolating
  CO-RESPONSE SELECTION means beating that pool, the SAME quantity as C3 absorber-recovery. These fuse with (i) causal ML's
  counterfactual invariance (Veitch 2021) and concept-erasure (LEACE, Belrose 2024) for the conceded surface-invariant baseline;
  (ii) NLP minimal-pair counterfactuals (ParaDetox, Kaushik 2020 CAD, CEBaB aspects) for non-circular perturbations and independent
  sub-context labels. The unifying insight an interpretability expert would not reach for: SAE splitting and absorption are
  TWO structurally different obstacles -- shared-support correlation (matched by DiffCoEx-style co-response correlation) vs
  disjoint-support coverage (matched by set-cover) -- the same dichotomy that distinguishes co-expression modules from complementary-pathway
  gene sets in biology, and the recovered absorbers ARE the latent subpopulations a robust classifier needs.

- term: Two-track clustering algorithm (the named contribution)
  definition: >-
    The grouping procedure: a C-TRACK that clusters content-responsive latents by positive content-response correlation (Leiden
    communities) for the SPLITTING regime where members share firing support, and a SEPARATE K-TRACK anchored greedy maximum-coverage
    for the ABSORPTION regime where members are mutually exclusive in firing and respond on disjoint supports (so correlation
    cannot propose them). C-communities and K-covers are reconciled into one de-duplicated output and filtered by the single
    admission rule.
- term: Cover set of a latent
  definition: >-
    C_l = the set of content-flip pairs whose flip latent l reliably and precisely tracks: r_l(p) above a response threshold,
    the latent fires on the content-on member, and the latent's content-response precision on its own firing support is >=
    0.7. The K-track operates on these cover sets; coverage-complementarity is defined as set intersection with an anchor's
    hole set, never as a vague pairwise affinity.
- term: Anchor-based greedy maximum-coverage (K-track)
  definition: >-
    The absorption-regime proposer. ANCHOR = the content-responsive latent with the highest cover-set size (highest recall
    of the concept's content flips), chosen using ONLY the counterfactual pairs (NOT the Chanin absorption diagnostic). HOLES
    = pairs the anchor does not cover (the absorbed sub-contexts). GREEDY: repeatedly add the latent covering the most uncovered
    holes subject to mutual-exclusivity (firing Jaccard<0.1), precision>=0.7, and a marginal coverage-gain floor (>=0.05 with
    bootstrap CI excluding 0). Recovers {general latent, per-sub-context absorbers} by construction, which correlation-merging
    clustering cannot.
- term: Proposal-step pilot validation
  definition: >-
    A Tier-0, never-dropped check that the K-track set-cover, given only content-flip pairs, RECOVERS the parent+absorbers
    the supervised Chanin 2409.14507 diagnostic identifies (membership precision/recall above a random-membership null) --
    proving the algorithm can PROPOSE absorption units before C3 relies on them. A failure here is reported as a proposal-step
    failure (an honest negative).
- term: Non-spelling absorption testbed (C3 generality)
  definition: >-
    A second absorption hierarchy promoted into the never-dropped Tier-1a core -- a NUMERIC-QUANTITY hierarchy (general numeric-token
    latent with year/percentage/date absorbers) as primary, or a TAXONOMIC 'is-a-country' hierarchy as the pre-registered
    alternative -- scored by the FORM-FREE (domain-agnostic) probe-plus-ablation absorption diagnostic. It moves C3 from one
    synthetic spelling task to absorption as a phenomenon AND is a novel empirical test of whether absorption generalizes
    beyond spelling, with a honest-null fallback (if no specialist-filled holes exist, absorption is reported spelling-specific
    and C3 is scoped accordingly).
- term: Feature absorption
  definition: >-
    A sparsity-induced failure (Chanin 2409.14507, 2505.11756) requiring a parent->child hierarchy: the more specific child
    latent suppresses the firing of the more general parent latent, which then has unpredictable holes. Parent and child are
    MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE in firing (gerrymandered latents); absorption is worse at WIDER SAEs and documented empirically almost
    only on first-letter spelling.

    Splitting = one concept fragments across MANY latents (worse at larger width); sub-latents co-respond POSITIVELY to a
    content flip and share support -- the C-track (correlation) target. Hedging (Chanin 2505.11756) = a narrow SAE MERGES
    correlated features into a SINGLE polysemantic latent (worse at narrower width); a hedged single latent is NOT groupable
    but explains why inter-latent correlation exists.
- term: Interventional co-response (grouping criterion)
  definition: >-
    Latents belong to the same concept unit if they jointly track the content perturbation across contexts, even if their
    baseline activations never co-occur. Realized in two signatures via two operators: positive correlation of content-response
    profiles (signature C, splitting, C-track) and complementary coverage of an anchor's holes (signature K, absorption, K-track
    set-cover).
- term: Count-matched C1 comparison
  definition: >-
    For C1 the observational co-activation/geometry clusters (b)/(c) are CUT to the unit's exact member count k (top-k members
    by the same pooling rule), so a unit win is at matched pool size and cannot be a capacity/pooling artifact -- it shows
    co-response SELECTS the right members. Beating the single best raw latent (a) is a near-foregone capacity win reported
    only for completeness.
- term: Measured auditability repair loop
  definition: >-
    An always-run demo that operationalizes auditability as a result: pick an under-served sub-context (recall hole on the
    dense probe), read the knowledge graph to identify the absorber covering it, ADD it, and MEASURE recall recovery on that
    sub-context (bootstrap CI) against a random-content-responsive-latent-addition control, confirming a retrained label-free
    probe (k) exposes no per-sub-context member to add. Paired with an LLM-judge member-labeling agreement metric (predict
    each member's sub-context from logit-lens tokens + contexts) vs a shuffled-label null.
- term: Surface-invariant matched probe (baseline f, single hyperplane)
  definition: >-
    A counterfactually-matched diff-of-means/linear probe on content-flip residual deltas, made surface-invariant by ERASING
    the surface-flip direction via LEACE / mean-projection (Belrose 2024). A SINGLE hyperplane; the unit beating it is conceded
    to be a POOLING effect, not selection evidence.
- term: Supervised oracle pool (g) and count-and-pool-matched probe (h)
  definition: >-
    (g) pools the top-N SAE latents selected by SCR/TPP probe-attribution causal effect; because it ranks by MARGINAL attribution
    it silently drops absorbed latents firing only in narrow sub-contexts. (h) max-pools EXACTLY #members raw residual directions
    selected by the SAME SCR/TPP attribution, holding pool SIZE fixed so the only varying factor vs the unit is the membership/SELECTION
    criterion (co-response coverage vs marginal attribution). The unit-vs-(g)/(h) sliced-recall comparison is the selection-isolating
    headline test and equals C3 absorber-recovery.
- term: Oracle group-DRO probe (j) and label-free group-inference probe (k)
  definition: >-
    (j) a dense probe trained with a group-DRO objective using the TRUE independent sub-context labels = worst-group-robustness
    UPPER BOUND; the unit is predicted to APPROACH it without using labels. (k) a dense probe made group-robust WITHOUT sub-context
    labels via JTT-style high-loss upweighting or GEORGE-style representation clustering + group-DRO; like the unit it uses
    no sub-context labels, but it reweights EXAMPLES and retrains, whereas the unit groups FEATURES, is training-free, and
    is auditable.
- term: Selection-criterion isolation
  definition: >-
    The pre-registered ORDERING (f) single hyperplane < (g)/(h) count-matched marginal-attribution pools < unit co-response
    pool on worst-sub-context recall. The unit-vs-(g)/(h) comparison holds POOL SIZE FIXED and varies ONLY the membership/SELECTION
    rule (co-response set-cover vs marginal SCR/TPP ranking); both pool, so it isolates SELECTION. The structural claim reduces
    to: co-response COVERAGE admits the absorber marginal-attribution ranking drops -- the SAME quantity as C3 absorber-recovery.
    Beating (f) is conceded as pooling.
- term: Single unit admission rule
  definition: >-
    A proposed unit is admitted iff it clears signature C (within-unit content-response correlation > 95th-pct shuffled-pair
    null) OR signature K (matched best-of-random-k coverage null + the small-k absolute effect-size floor >=0.05 with bootstrap
    CI excluding 0, with mutual-exclusivity Jaccard<0.1 and per-member precision>=0.7), AND its pooled surface-response is
    not above the shuffled-surface null. The cleared signature is reported per concept and the false-admit rate under both
    nulls (target <=0.05). The rule FILTERS units the two-track algorithm PROPOSES.
- term: Load-bearing core
  definition: >-
    The minimal pre-registered result set the paper stands on regardless of robustness outcomes: pilot (incl. K-proposal recovery
    + non-triviality) + count-matched C1 + C3 absorber-recovery vs (g)/(h) + KG-edge agreement on first-letter AND one non-spelling
    absorption hierarchy. Measured against SAE-selection baselines, not the dense-probe aggregate-F1 bar, so it does not depend
    on out-classifying a strong dense probe.
summary: >-
  SAE latents encoding one concept are often mutually exclusive in firing (feature absorption and splitting), so observational
  co-activation, decoder geometry, and marginal-attribution selection all structurally miss the right members. We group frozen-SAE
  latents by how they jointly track a content counterfactual via a two-track algorithm -- correlation-community detection
  for shared-support splitting, and an anchored greedy SET-COVER for disjoint-support absorption (which correlation cannot
  even propose) -- producing training-free, auditable multi-member units. The load-bearing result is that the unit beats raw
  latents and COUNT-MATCHED observational clusters and recovers the absorbers a count-matched marginal-attribution selection
  drops on BOTH first-letter spelling AND one non-spelling hierarchy (KG edges agreeing with the absorption diagnostic); a
  measured auditability repair loop and worst-sub-context robustness approaching an oracle group-DRO probe without labels
  are supporting results.

title: Absorption Diagnostic + Pinned Datasets Dossier for Two-Track SAE Grouping
summary: >-
  Executor-ready dossier de-risking the C3 absorption spine and pinning every data/infra build for the two-track co-response
  SAE-grouping experiment. WP1 extracts the Chanin 2409.14507 absorption diagnostic verified against the lasr-spelling/sae-spelling
  code: parent latent = max ENCODER-cosine with an LR probe (+ k-sparse splits at f1-jump 0.03); absorber = largest-negative
  integrated-gradients ablation (IG steps=6) on the first-letter logit-diff m=g[y]-mean(g[incorrect]); decision thresholds
  probe_cos_sim_threshold=0.025 computed on the DECODER (sae.W_dec), ablation_delta_threshold=1.0, EPS=1e-8, 200-FN cap, topk=10;
  absorption_rate=num_absorptions/lr_probe_true_positives; valid only layers 0-17. It also supplies the strictly non-circular
  FORM-FREE version the paper itself gives in Appendix A.13 (and SAEBench implements as absorption_fraction): latent l absorbs
  iff tau_c < (a_hat_l . d_p)/(a . d_p) with a_hat_l = enc_act*W_dec[l] and d_p the parent-concept LR-probe direction trained
  on data DISJOINT from clustering -- works at all layers, no output logit needed, never used to form units. WP2 confirms
  absorption is empirically documented ONLY on first-letter spelling (LessWrong toy-models post; SAEBench eval id 'absorption_first_letter';
  Matryoshka/H-SAE only mitigate via the spelling metric), making Testbed-2 both a generality test and a novel empirical test;
  numeric-quantity hierarchy is recommended primary (taxonomic country alternative) with concrete non-triviality gates (parent
  recall >=0.60; >=1 absorber with firing-Jaccard<0.10, sub-context precision>=0.70, hole-coverage gain>=0.05 with bootstrap
  CI excluding 0) and an honest-null fallback that scopes C3 to spelling and routes generality through C1. WP3 pins HF datasets:
  s-nlp/paradetox (en_toxic_comment/en_neutral_comment, 19,744 rows, openrail++); google/civil_comments (text + 7 float32
  sub-attrs, 1.8M/97k/97k, CC0, 414.95MB -> subsample); tasksource/counterfactually-augmented-imdb (Text/Sentiment, no pair-ids
  -> acmi-lab GitHub for pairing, license unknown); CEBaB/CEBaB (full aspect-majority schema, license NOT on card = TODO);
  LabHC/bias_in_bios (hard_text/profession-int64-0-27/gender, 257k/39.6k/99.1k, 266MB, MIT, full alphabetical profession map).
  WP4 gives generation prompts + an independent LLM-judge rubric and verified June-2026 OpenRouter prices (generator google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite
  $0.25/$1.50 or deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash $0.09/$0.18; judge anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5 $1.00/$5.00), totalling ~$5.9-7.6
  for ~5,000 pairs with a hard $10 stop. WP5 captures sae-spelling get_alpha_tokens (convert_tokens_to_string then strip one
  leading space then all-alpha) and prompt template '{word} has the first letter:'; pins pile-uncopyrighted rev 3be9033 (2023-08-31,

  d_model=2304) + the 65k variant. CRITICAL model-diffing finding: NO gemma-scope-2b-it SAE exists anywhere (Google IT residual
  SAEs only for 9B) -> use the SHARED pt SAE on both gemma-2-2b and gemma-2-2b-it activations; both Google models are gated,

  First-Letter-Spelling Absorption Testbed (L/O/T/I/D): minimal pairs + frozen Pile corpus
summary: |-
  First-Letter-Spelling Absorption Testbed — the load-bearing dataset for the Two-Track Co-Response Grouping hypothesis (building reliable cluster-level units from individual SAE latents). Pure CPU/data artifact: NO SAE, no model weights, no GPU. 17,180 examples in 5 per-letter dataset groups (first_letter_spelling_{L,O,T,I,D}; L primary, O/T/I/D secondary; degenerate S/X excluded), schema exp_sel_data_out (full/mini/preview all PASSED).

  Three linked components per letter: (A) content_flip minimal pairs — (x_on,x_off) in an IDENTICAL carrier where x_on slots a word STARTING WITH the target letter and x_off a surface-matched word that does NOT (matched on char length, single-token-ness, Pile log-frequency); 1,750 pairs / 3,500 rows. Feeds the Tier-0 K-track anchored set-cover PROPOSAL pilot and the C3 absorber-recovery spine; reconstruct via metadata_pair_id and compute r_l=a_l(x_on)-a_l(x_off). (B) surface_flip pairs — (x_a,x_b) in an identical carrier, BOTH words start with the target letter but differ; 590 pairs / 1,180 rows; for the unit-level surface-invariance admission check (pooled response to surface flips ~0). (C) corpus_context — 12,500 real ~48-token windows (2,500/letter) from monology/pile-uncopyrighted @ rev 3be9033, each centred on a slot-eligible word-initial target-letter token with token_position annotated; plus a per-letter occurrence table (<=2,000 word-types) in dataset-level metadata — the substrate for iteration-2's form-free/Chanin (2409.14507) absorption diagnostic to locate false-negative absorbers (e.g. lion, London).

  Words are anchored in the real gemma-2-2b vocabulary (unsloth/gemma-2-2b ungated mirror, vocab==256000) via the exact sae-spelling get_alpha_tokens slot-eligibility recipe (word-initial '_' marker AND alpha). 7 carriers per content pair: sae-spelling spelling prompts (t_verbose '{word} has the first letter:', t_colon, t_icl with contamination-free ICL examples) + 4 word-class-agnostic mention carriers.

  Row schema is FLAT (exp_sel_data_out): input, output (first letter, uppercase), and metadata_* keys (dataset, letter, pair_id, pair_type, role, sub_context=the word covered, target_word, counterpart_word, template_id, label_starts_with_target, is_single_token, is_slot_eligible, first_letter, fold, word_char_span; corpus rows add source_doc_id, pile_revision, token_position, target_token_id, window_char_span, target_char_in_window). Pairs LINK via shared metadata_pair_id + metadata_role ({on,off}/{var_a,var_b}). Folds: minimal pairs by target_word, corpus by source_doc_id (5 folds, no leakage).

  Validation: the deterministic check is AUTHORITATIVE and reports 0 violations / 17,180 rows (flip property + input-span correctness are guaranteed by construction). The LLM judge (google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite, $0.12 total, < $3 cap) is a SECONDARY grammaticality/independent audit with pass rates 0.89-0.99 per (letter,pair_type); judge false-negatives are retained because the deterministic check governs drops. Corpus token_position verified EXACT (tok(input,add_special_tokens=False)[token_position]==target_token_id) on sampled rows. Frozen & reproducible: pinned tokenizer + Pile revision 3be90335..., seed 1234, deps pinned in pyproject.toml; data.py rebuilds end-to-end. full_data_out.json=21MB (<100MB, no split). NOTE: iteration-2 reads SAE activations on these inputs; this artifact itself does not run the SAE.

title: 'Non-Spelling SAE Absorption Testbed: Numeric & Taxonomic Hierarchies'
summary: |-
  TEXT-ONLY dataset (no SAE/model/activation computation here) for testing whether SAE feature absorption — documented almost exclusively on first-letter spelling — generalizes to two NON-spelling parent concepts. It is the never-dropped C3-spine testbed for the Counterfactual Co-Response Grouping hypothesis. Output is the AII exp_sel_data_out schema (one example per data row; per-row metadata flattened to metadata_* keys, since nested objects are disallowed), grouped into exactly two datasets:
  • numeric_absorption (8,380 examples): parent = 'token is numeric (a digit / part of a number)'; absorber sub-contexts = year, percent, currency, date, decimal, integer, comma_number, ordinal (year/percent/currency/date are the primary candidates).
  • taxonomic_absorption (15,748 examples): parent = 'token is part of a country name'; absorber sub-contexts = individual countries.

  Each hierarchy ships three coordinated components: (A) content-flip minimal pairs — x_on contains the concept, x_off a surface-matched non-concept word at the same slot (taxonomic uses country-vs-city and country-vs-other-proper-noun negative families); (B) surface-flip pairs — same concept token in two different carrier sentences, for the unit-level surface-invariance admission check; (C) a frozen pile-uncopyrighted (rev 3be90335b66f24456a5d6659d9c8d208c0357119) diagnostic corpus of real natural-text windows labelled by frozen sub-context, plus matched negatives (no-digit, city-mention, no-country), so iter-2 can train a parent linear probe and run the per-sub-context false-negative (parent-hole) search.

  Every row marks the exact target span (target_text + char_start/char_end) and carries precomputed google/gemma-2-2b token indices (100% coverage; the tokenizer splits numbers into individual digit tokens). Sub-context labels are assigned purely from surface form / regex / gazetteer (pycountry + geonamescache) — independent of any SAE latent or model behaviour — so the degenerate-construction guard holds and the same labelled corpus equally supports the honest 'absorption is spelling-specific' null (uniform high parent-probe recall across sub-contexts). Frozen folds (seed 20240617): pairs split train/test 70/30 by pair_id (stratified by sub_context); corpus splits train/diagnostic 50/50 (stratified). absorption_readiness in manifest.json: ALL 8 numeric sub-contexts and 20 countries reach ≥150 diagnostic-fold positives (eligible for the inferential test); rarer sub-contexts/countries are kept and flagged descriptive_only. Content-flip (≥240) and surface-flip (≥120) per-hierarchy floors are exceeded. A deterministic templated backbone is supplemented by openai/gpt-4o-mini generation, with every content/surface pair (LLM-generated + 20% templated spot-check) LLM-judged on content_flipped/surface_preserved/grammatical — 100% pass at $0.0104 total spend (hard cap $4, ceiling $10). Ambiguous homographs (Georgia, Turkey, Chile, Jordan) and multi-word countries are flagged via metadata_notes / metadata_multi_token.

  Deliverables: data.py (canonical builder), pipeline.py + build_dataset.py (logic modules), full/mini/preview_data_out.json, schema.json (JSON Schema + logical nested view), manifest.json (per-sub-context counts, fold counts, pass rates, spend, pile revision, readiness), and pyproject.toml with pinned dependency versions. Reproduce with `python3 data.py --scale full`. iter-2 consumes this to run the Tier-0 non-triviality pre-check (does a high-recall parent latent exist AND have specialist-filled holes?), the form-free absorption diagnostic as oracle, and the K-track anchored greedy set-cover proposal step — with numeric as the primary novelty test and taxonomic as the pre-registered alternative.

title: 'Two-Track CCRG Toxicity Family: ParaDetox flips + civil_comments sub-contexts'
summary: >-
  A single schema-standardized TOXICITY dataset family for the Two-Track CCRG experiments (organizing SAE latents into reliable
  group-level units). 37,707 examples in the exp_sel_data_out schema, grouped into the two real source corpora and validated.
  THE BEST 2 DATASETS are the dataset groups: (1) paradetox = s-nlp/paradetox (Logacheva et al., ACL 2022; openrail++), 19,096
  rows; (2) civil_comments = google/civil_comments (Jigsaw Unintended Bias, Borkan et al. 2019; CC0 1.0), 18,611 rows. Three
  role-distinct components are carried via metadata_record_type: (a) content_pair (18,853) = human toxic<->neutral parallel
  sentences, the NON-CIRCULAR content perturbation P (metadata_text_on / metadata_text_off) for per-latent content-response;
  (b) surface_pair (546) = OpenRouter gpt-4o-mini toxic->toxic paraphrases (input / metadata_text_paired), double-gated (token
  Jaccard<0.6 AND norm edit-dist>0.25 AND LLM-judge toxicity_preserved+meaning_preserved; judge pass 70.6%, refusal 1.5%,
  cost $0.060), the surface-invariance control, folded into their seed corpus's group via metadata_origin_source; (c) classification
  (18,308) = civil_comments comments with a binary metadata_toxicity_label plus FROZEN multi-label sub-context labels (severe_toxicity,
  obscene, threat, insult, identity_attack, sexual_explicit) thresholded at 0.5 from the raw annotator-fraction floats (preserved
  in metadata_subcontext_floats for re-thresholding). Power: obscene/threat/insult/identity_attack/sexual_explicit are inferential@0.5
  with >=150 positives in every eval fold; severe_toxicity is flagged descriptive_only (too rare even at 0.3) -- not silently
  dropped. data_summary.json reports per-sub-context per-fold counts at 0.5 and 0.3, the sub-attribute pairwise Jaccard co-occurrence
  matrix (insult<->obscene ~0.245 shared-support => C-track; threat/identity_attack <0.05 disjoint => K-track), generation
  stats, and 316 reconciled cross-source collisions. Leakage-safe doc-level folds (metadata_fold in train/val/test) via union-find
  over normalized text: civil_comments keeps native splits; verified 0 pair_id and 0 source_sentence_id spanning folds and
  0 normalized texts in >1 fold. Sanity baselines (TF-IDF+logistic regression, train->test): toxicity AUC 0.851/F1 0.773;
  sub-contexts AUC 0.81-0.94; content_pair mean cos 0.685 (genuine flip), surface_pair 0.355 (reworded not copied). Files:

summary: >-
  Three REAL, human-annotated datasets standardized into the CCRG shared minimal-pair schema and emitted in the canonical
  exp_sel_data_out format ({metadata, datasets:[{dataset, examples:[{input, output, metadata_*}]}]}), ONE example per text
  row, grouped by dataset, $0 LLM spend. Families (separable via metadata_family): (1) sentiment = CAD-IMDB (Kaushik et al.
  ICLR 2020), 4,880 rows / 2,440 human counterfactual content-flip pairs (positive<->negative), supporting; (2) restaurant_aspect
  = CEBaB (Abraham et al. NeurIPS 2022), 5,682 rows / 2,841 pairs (food 1,740 + service 1,101) flipping ONE aspect's sentiment
  with all four aspect majorities (food/service/ambiance/noise) + binarized review_sentiment retained as INDEPENDENT sub_context
  labels, supporting; (3) bias_in_bios_boundary = LabHC/bias_in_bios (De-Arteaga et al. 2019), 20,177 profession bios (28
  classes, gender as independent sub-context), the PRE-REGISTERED boundary-null where habitat~=label. Total 30,739 rows, 5,281
  reconstructable minimal pairs. Per row: input(text), output(canonical label), and metadata_* fields: id, family, dataset_source,
  concept(sentiment|food_sentiment|service_sentiment|profession), concept_label, sub_context(dict), pair_id, partner_id, pair_role(content_on|content_off|null),
  flip_type(content|null), is_content_pair, is_surface_pair(false for all), fold(train|dev|test), meta(raw fields incl char_len,
  token_overlap_with_partner, raw labels, subsample seed). Every (x_off,x_on) content pair is reconstructable via pair_id/partner_id
  (content_on=positive/concept-present member). is_surface_pair=false everywhere — surface flips are out of scope here (reserved
  for sibling ParaDetox/LLM artifacts); no surface pairs fabricated. NO derived statistics (MI/probes) computed — raw standardized
  data only. Every row validated against schema.json (jsonschema Draft7) AND full/mini/preview validated against exp_sel_data_out
  (aii-json). THREE plan errors were caught and corrected by empirical verification: (a) CAD-IMDB orig/<->new/ row alignment
  is FALSE (flip_rate~0.50, aligned Jaccard~=random~0.11) — authoritative pairing taken from the repo's combined/paired/*_paired.tsv
  via shared batch_id (true-pair Jaccard 0.816 vs random 0.108); (b) CEBaB edit_type is the edited ASPECT {food,service,ambiance,noise}
  and edit_goal is the target sentiment (the plan swapped them), and review_majority is a 1-5 star rating (binarized 1,2->neg
  / 4,5->pos / 3->neutral); (c) bias_in_bios ships no ClassLabel names, so the canonical 28-occupation alphabetical mapping
  (incl 'dj' at index 8) was verified empirically 17/17 by keyword hit-rate (nurse=13, attorney=2, surgeon=25, software_engineer=24,
  yoga_teacher=27), gender 0=male/1=female confirmed by pronouns; stratified (profession x gender, 56 strata) capped subsample
  with fixed seed 20240617, gender-balanced (male 10,054 / female 10,123). Licenses: CAD Apache-2.0, CEBaB CC-BY-4.0, bias_in_bios
  MIT. Reproduce all deliverables with `uv run data.py`. Downstream guidance: compute per-family bootstrap CIs as primary
  (families cleanly separated); treat any bias_in_bios null as the expected boundary outcome, not method failure; build content
  (x_off,x_on) deltas from pair_id.

summary: >-
  Executor-ready dossier de-risking the C3 absorption spine and pinning every data/infra build for the two-track co-response
  SAE-grouping experiment. WP1 extracts the Chanin 2409.14507 absorption diagnostic verified against the lasr-spelling/sae-spelling
  code: parent latent = max ENCODER-cosine with an LR probe (+ k-sparse splits at f1-jump 0.03); absorber = largest-negative
  integrated-gradients ablation (IG steps=6) on the first-letter logit-diff m=g[y]-mean(g[incorrect]); decision thresholds
  probe_cos_sim_threshold=0.025 computed on the DECODER (sae.W_dec), ablation_delta_threshold=1.0, EPS=1e-8, 200-FN cap, topk=10;
  absorption_rate=num_absorptions/lr_probe_true_positives; valid only layers 0-17. It also supplies the strictly non-circular
  FORM-FREE version the paper itself gives in Appendix A.13 (and SAEBench implements as absorption_fraction): latent l absorbs
  iff tau_c < (a_hat_l . d_p)/(a . d_p) with a_hat_l = enc_act*W_dec[l] and d_p the parent-concept LR-probe direction trained
  on data DISJOINT from clustering -- works at all layers, no output logit needed, never used to form units. WP2 confirms
  absorption is empirically documented ONLY on first-letter spelling (LessWrong toy-models post; SAEBench eval id 'absorption_first_letter';
  Matryoshka/H-SAE only mitigate via the spelling metric), making Testbed-2 both a generality test and a novel empirical test;
  numeric-quantity hierarchy is recommended primary (taxonomic country alternative) with concrete non-triviality gates (parent
  recall >=0.60; >=1 absorber with firing-Jaccard<0.10, sub-context precision>=0.70, hole-coverage gain>=0.05 with bootstrap
  CI excluding 0) and an honest-null fallback that scopes C3 to spelling and routes generality through C1. WP3 pins HF datasets:
  s-nlp/paradetox (en_toxic_comment/en_neutral_comment, 19,744 rows, openrail++); google/civil_comments (text + 7 float32
  sub-attrs, 1.8M/97k/97k, CC0, 414.95MB -> subsample); tasksource/counterfactually-augmented-imdb (Text/Sentiment, no pair-ids
  -> acmi-lab GitHub for pairing, license unknown); CEBaB/CEBaB (full aspect-majority schema, license NOT on card = TODO);
  LabHC/bias_in_bios (hard_text/profession-int64-0-27/gender, 257k/39.6k/99.1k, 266MB, MIT, full alphabetical profession map).
  WP4 gives generation prompts + an independent LLM-judge rubric and verified June-2026 OpenRouter prices (generator google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite
  $0.25/$1.50 or deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash $0.09/$0.18; judge anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5 $1.00/$5.00), totalling ~$5.9-7.6
  for ~5,000 pairs with a hard $10 stop. WP5 captures sae-spelling get_alpha_tokens (convert_tokens_to_string then strip one
  leading space then all-alpha) and prompt template '{word} has the first letter:'; pins pile-uncopyrighted rev 3be9033 (2023-08-31,
  non-streaming); and SAE.from_pretrained(release='gemma-scope-2b-pt-res-canonical', sae_id='layer_12/width_16k/canonical',
  d_model=2304) + the 65k variant. CRITICAL model-diffing finding: NO gemma-scope-2b-it SAE exists anywhere (Google IT residual
  SAEs only for 9B) -> use the SHARED pt SAE on both gemma-2-2b and gemma-2-2b-it activations; both Google models are gated,
  use unsloth/gemma-2-2b(-it) mirrors. Full detail in research_report.md; every pinned fact and citation is in research_out.json.
title: Absorption Diagnostic + Pinned Datasets Dossier for Two-Track SAE Grouping

type: dataset
id: art_dpYpjSn2Xvg3
summary: |-
  First-Letter-Spelling Absorption Testbed — the load-bearing dataset for the Two-Track Co-Response Grouping hypothesis (building reliable cluster-level units from individual SAE latents). Pure CPU/data artifact: NO SAE, no model weights, no GPU. 17,180 examples in 5 per-letter dataset groups (first_letter_spelling_{L,O,T,I,D}; L primary, O/T/I/D secondary; degenerate S/X excluded), schema exp_sel_data_out (full/mini/preview all PASSED).

  Three linked components per letter: (A) content_flip minimal pairs — (x_on,x_off) in an IDENTICAL carrier where x_on slots a word STARTING WITH the target letter and x_off a surface-matched word that does NOT (matched on char length, single-token-ness, Pile log-frequency); 1,750 pairs / 3,500 rows. Feeds the Tier-0 K-track anchored set-cover PROPOSAL pilot and the C3 absorber-recovery spine; reconstruct via metadata_pair_id and compute r_l=a_l(x_on)-a_l(x_off). (B) surface_flip pairs — (x_a,x_b) in an identical carrier, BOTH words start with the target letter but differ; 590 pairs / 1,180 rows; for the unit-level surface-invariance admission check (pooled response to surface flips ~0). (C) corpus_context — 12,500 real ~48-token windows (2,500/letter) from monology/pile-uncopyrighted @ rev 3be9033, each centred on a slot-eligible word-initial target-letter token with token_position annotated; plus a per-letter occurrence table (<=2,000 word-types) in dataset-level metadata — the substrate for iteration-2's form-free/Chanin (2409.14507) absorption diagnostic to locate false-negative absorbers (e.g. lion, London).

  Words are anchored in the real gemma-2-2b vocabulary (unsloth/gemma-2-2b ungated mirror, vocab==256000) via the exact sae-spelling get_alpha_tokens slot-eligibility recipe (word-initial '_' marker AND alpha). 7 carriers per content pair: sae-spelling spelling prompts (t_verbose '{word} has the first letter:', t_colon, t_icl with contamination-free ICL examples) + 4 word-class-agnostic mention carriers.

  Row schema is FLAT (exp_sel_data_out): input, output (first letter, uppercase), and metadata_* keys (dataset, letter, pair_id, pair_type, role, sub_context=the word covered, target_word, counterpart_word, template_id, label_starts_with_target, is_single_token, is_slot_eligible, first_letter, fold, word_char_span; corpus rows add source_doc_id, pile_revision, token_position, target_token_id, window_char_span, target_char_in_window). Pairs LINK via shared metadata_pair_id + metadata_role ({on,off}/{var_a,var_b}). Folds: minimal pairs by target_word, corpus by source_doc_id (5 folds, no leakage).

  Validation: the deterministic check is AUTHORITATIVE and reports 0 violations / 17,180 rows (flip property + input-span correctness are guaranteed by construction). The LLM judge (google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite, $0.12 total, < $3 cap) is a SECONDARY grammaticality/independent audit with pass rates 0.89-0.99 per (letter,pair_type); judge false-negatives are retained because the deterministic check governs drops. Corpus token_position verified EXACT (tok(input,add_special_tokens=False)[token_position]==target_token_id) on sampled rows. Frozen & reproducible: pinned tokenizer + Pile revision 3be90335..., seed 1234, deps pinned in pyproject.toml; data.py rebuilds end-to-end. full_data_out.json=21MB (<100MB, no split). NOTE: iteration-2 reads SAE activations on these inputs; this artifact itself does not run the SAE.

  First-Letter-Spelling Absorption Testbed (L/O/T/I/D): minimal pairs + frozen Pile corpus

type: dataset
id: art_t2uUbjSwpd3t
summary: |-
  TEXT-ONLY dataset (no SAE/model/activation computation here) for testing whether SAE feature absorption — documented almost exclusively on first-letter spelling — generalizes to two NON-spelling parent concepts. It is the never-dropped C3-spine testbed for the Counterfactual Co-Response Grouping hypothesis. Output is the AII exp_sel_data_out schema (one example per data row; per-row metadata flattened to metadata_* keys, since nested objects are disallowed), grouped into exactly two datasets:
  • numeric_absorption (8,380 examples): parent = 'token is numeric (a digit / part of a number)'; absorber sub-contexts = year, percent, currency, date, decimal, integer, comma_number, ordinal (year/percent/currency/date are the primary candidates).
  • taxonomic_absorption (15,748 examples): parent = 'token is part of a country name'; absorber sub-contexts = individual countries.

  Each hierarchy ships three coordinated components: (A) content-flip minimal pairs — x_on contains the concept, x_off a surface-matched non-concept word at the same slot (taxonomic uses country-vs-city and country-vs-other-proper-noun negative families); (B) surface-flip pairs — same concept token in two different carrier sentences, for the unit-level surface-invariance admission check; (C) a frozen pile-uncopyrighted (rev 3be90335b66f24456a5d6659d9c8d208c0357119) diagnostic corpus of real natural-text windows labelled by frozen sub-context, plus matched negatives (no-digit, city-mention, no-country), so iter-2 can train a parent linear probe and run the per-sub-context false-negative (parent-hole) search.

  Every row marks the exact target span (target_text + char_start/char_end) and carries precomputed google/gemma-2-2b token indices (100% coverage; the tokenizer splits numbers into individual digit tokens). Sub-context labels are assigned purely from surface form / regex / gazetteer (pycountry + geonamescache) — independent of any SAE latent or model behaviour — so the degenerate-construction guard holds and the same labelled corpus equally supports the honest 'absorption is spelling-specific' null (uniform high parent-probe recall across sub-contexts). Frozen folds (seed 20240617): pairs split train/test 70/30 by pair_id (stratified by sub_context); corpus splits train/diagnostic 50/50 (stratified). absorption_readiness in manifest.json: ALL 8 numeric sub-contexts and 20 countries reach ≥150 diagnostic-fold positives (eligible for the inferential test); rarer sub-contexts/countries are kept and flagged descriptive_only. Content-flip (≥240) and surface-flip (≥120) per-hierarchy floors are exceeded. A deterministic templated backbone is supplemented by openai/gpt-4o-mini generation, with every content/surface pair (LLM-generated + 20% templated spot-check) LLM-judged on content_flipped/surface_preserved/grammatical — 100% pass at $0.0104 total spend (hard cap $4, ceiling $10). Ambiguous homographs (Georgia, Turkey, Chile, Jordan) and multi-word countries are flagged via metadata_notes / metadata_multi_token.

  Deliverables: data.py (canonical builder), pipeline.py + build_dataset.py (logic modules), full/mini/preview_data_out.json, schema.json (JSON Schema + logical nested view), manifest.json (per-sub-context counts, fold counts, pass rates, spend, pile revision, readiness), and pyproject.toml with pinned dependency versions. Reproduce with `python3 data.py --scale full`. iter-2 consumes this to run the Tier-0 non-triviality pre-check (does a high-recall parent latent exist AND have specialist-filled holes?), the form-free absorption diagnostic as oracle, and the K-track anchored greedy set-cover proposal step — with numeric as the primary novelty test and taxonomic as the pre-registered alternative.

summary: >-
  A single schema-standardized TOXICITY dataset family for the Two-Track CCRG experiments (organizing SAE latents into reliable
  group-level units). 37,707 examples in the exp_sel_data_out schema, grouped into the two real source corpora and validated.
  THE BEST 2 DATASETS are the dataset groups: (1) paradetox = s-nlp/paradetox (Logacheva et al., ACL 2022; openrail++), 19,096
  rows; (2) civil_comments = google/civil_comments (Jigsaw Unintended Bias, Borkan et al. 2019; CC0 1.0), 18,611 rows. Three
  role-distinct components are carried via metadata_record_type: (a) content_pair (18,853) = human toxic<->neutral parallel
  sentences, the NON-CIRCULAR content perturbation P (metadata_text_on / metadata_text_off) for per-latent content-response;
  (b) surface_pair (546) = OpenRouter gpt-4o-mini toxic->toxic paraphrases (input / metadata_text_paired), double-gated (token
  Jaccard<0.6 AND norm edit-dist>0.25 AND LLM-judge toxicity_preserved+meaning_preserved; judge pass 70.6%, refusal 1.5%,
  cost $0.060), the surface-invariance control, folded into their seed corpus's group via metadata_origin_source; (c) classification
  (18,308) = civil_comments comments with a binary metadata_toxicity_label plus FROZEN multi-label sub-context labels (severe_toxicity,
  obscene, threat, insult, identity_attack, sexual_explicit) thresholded at 0.5 from the raw annotator-fraction floats (preserved
  in metadata_subcontext_floats for re-thresholding). Power: obscene/threat/insult/identity_attack/sexual_explicit are inferential@0.5
  with >=150 positives in every eval fold; severe_toxicity is flagged descriptive_only (too rare even at 0.3) -- not silently
  dropped. data_summary.json reports per-sub-context per-fold counts at 0.5 and 0.3, the sub-attribute pairwise Jaccard co-occurrence
  matrix (insult<->obscene ~0.245 shared-support => C-track; threat/identity_attack <0.05 disjoint => K-track), generation
  stats, and 316 reconciled cross-source collisions. Leakage-safe doc-level folds (metadata_fold in train/val/test) via union-find
  over normalized text: civil_comments keeps native splits; verified 0 pair_id and 0 source_sentence_id spanning folds and
  0 normalized texts in >1 fold. Sanity baselines (TF-IDF+logistic regression, train->test): toxicity AUC 0.851/F1 0.773;
  sub-contexts AUC 0.81-0.94; content_pair mean cos 0.685 (genuine flip), surface_pair 0.355 (reworded not copied). Files:
  data.py (stdlib-only uv assembler), full/mini/preview_data_out.json (validated), data_summary.json, README.md, pyproject.toml
  (47 pinned deps), and build/ (staged pipeline: ParaDetox content-flips, civil_comments stream-filter, OpenRouter surface
  generation, assembler, verify_baseline). Downstream consumers flatten datasets[*].examples and filter metadata_record_type.

  Three REAL, human-annotated datasets standardized into the CCRG shared minimal-pair schema and emitted in the canonical
  exp_sel_data_out format ({metadata, datasets:[{dataset, examples:[{input, output, metadata_*}]}]}), ONE example per text
  row, grouped by dataset, $0 LLM spend. Families (separable via metadata_family): (1) sentiment = CAD-IMDB (Kaushik et al.
  ICLR 2020), 4,880 rows / 2,440 human counterfactual content-flip pairs (positive<->negative), supporting; (2) restaurant_aspect
  = CEBaB (Abraham et al. NeurIPS 2022), 5,682 rows / 2,841 pairs (food 1,740 + service 1,101) flipping ONE aspect's sentiment
  with all four aspect majorities (food/service/ambiance/noise) + binarized review_sentiment retained as INDEPENDENT sub_context
  labels, supporting; (3) bias_in_bios_boundary = LabHC/bias_in_bios (De-Arteaga et al. 2019), 20,177 profession bios (28
  classes, gender as independent sub-context), the PRE-REGISTERED boundary-null where habitat~=label. Total 30,739 rows, 5,281
  reconstructable minimal pairs. Per row: input(text), output(canonical label), and metadata_* fields: id, family, dataset_source,
  concept(sentiment|food_sentiment|service_sentiment|profession), concept_label, sub_context(dict), pair_id, partner_id, pair_role(content_on|content_off|null),
  flip_type(content|null), is_content_pair, is_surface_pair(false for all), fold(train|dev|test), meta(raw fields incl char_len,
  token_overlap_with_partner, raw labels, subsample seed). Every (x_off,x_on) content pair is reconstructable via pair_id/partner_id
  (content_on=positive/concept-present member). is_surface_pair=false everywhere — surface flips are out of scope here (reserved
  for sibling ParaDetox/LLM artifacts); no surface pairs fabricated. NO derived statistics (MI/probes) computed — raw standardized
  data only. Every row validated against schema.json (jsonschema Draft7) AND full/mini/preview validated against exp_sel_data_out
  (aii-json). THREE plan errors were caught and corrected by empirical verification: (a) CAD-IMDB orig/<->new/ row alignment
  is FALSE (flip_rate~0.50, aligned Jaccard~=random~0.11) — authoritative pairing taken from the repo's combined/paired/*_paired.tsv
  via shared batch_id (true-pair Jaccard 0.816 vs random 0.108); (b) CEBaB edit_type is the edited ASPECT {food,service,ambiance,noise}
  and edit_goal is the target sentiment (the plan swapped them), and review_majority is a 1-5 star rating (binarized 1,2->neg
  / 4,5->pos / 3->neutral); (c) bias_in_bios ships no ClassLabel names, so the canonical 28-occupation alphabetical mapping
  (incl 'dj' at index 8) was verified empirically 17/17 by keyword hit-rate (nurse=13, attorney=2, surgeon=25, software_engineer=24,
  yoga_teacher=27), gender 0=male/1=female confirmed by pronouns; stratified (profession x gender, 56 strata) capped subsample
  with fixed seed 20240617, gender-balanced (male 10,054 / female 10,123). Licenses: CAD Apache-2.0, CEBaB CC-BY-4.0, bias_in_bios
  MIT. Reproduce all deliverables with `uv run data.py`. Downstream guidance: compute per-family bootstrap CIs as primary
  (families cleanly separated); treat any bias_in_bios null as the expected boundary outcome, not method failure; build content
  (x_off,x_on) deltas from pair_id.

<task>
Write a research paper draft with LaTeX-ready text, BibTeX citations, and figure placeholders.

This is the FIRST paper draft. Write a complete research paper from scratch based on the hypothesis and all available artifacts.
</task>

<figure_instructions>
FIGURE FORMAT: Use [FIGURE:fig_id] markers in paper_text to indicate where each figure goes.
Then provide the full figure specs in the separate `figures` structured output array.
Each figure in the array must have an `id` matching a marker in the text. Set the `aspect_ratio`
field per figure: 21:9 for architecture / pipeline / flow-chart diagrams (the hero figure should
be one of these — place its marker near the END of the Introduction so it floats to the top of
page 2), 16:9 for comparisons / multi-panel results, 4:3 for dense charts, 1:1 for heatmaps /
confusion matrices / scatter plots.

Example in paper_text:
  "...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.\n\n[FIGURE:fig3]\n\nThe results demonstrate..."

Example in figures array (results comparison):
  {"id": "fig3", "title": "Performance Comparison", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: latency (seconds, 0-5). Values: PostgreSQL=4.6s (red), Bao=2.8s (blue), RLQOpt=2.0s (green). Error bars +/-0.3-0.8. Sans-serif font, white background.", "aspect_ratio": "16:9", "summary": "Compares latency across optimizers"}

Example in figures array (architecture diagram, hero):
  {"id": "fig1", "title": "System Architecture", "caption": "End-to-end pipeline: encoder feeds latents into the planner, which queries the value head before emitting actions.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Horizontal flow diagram, left to right. Five labeled boxes: 'Input' (gray), 'Encoder' (blue), 'Latent (z, 256-dim)' (light blue, narrow), 'Planner' (green), 'Action Head' (orange). Arrows labeled with shapes. Value head as separate green box below 'Planner', bidirectional arrow. Sans-serif font, clean white background, no 3D.", "aspect_ratio": "21:9", "summary": "Hero architecture diagram"}

CRITICAL: Before writing figure specs, look through artifact workspace output files (*_out.json)
and code to find ALL the exact values. The figure generator cannot read files — every exact number
and value MUST be in the image_gen_detailed_description.
</figure_instructions>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-paper-writing, aii-semscholar-bib.
TODO 2. LITERATURE REVIEW: Use web search tools to research the landscape — search key terms from
<hypothesis> and <all_artifacts>. Then use aii_semscholar_bib__fetch to batch-fetch real
BibTeX entries. Build a comprehensive Related Work section. Do NOT fabricate entries.
TODO 3. READ ARTIFACTS: Before writing each section, READ the relevant artifact source code, output
files, and data in the workspace. Extract concrete implementation details, technical innovations,
algorithmic specifics, and quantitative results. Do NOT write surface-level descriptions.

ARTIFACT REFERENCES: When you reference results, methodology, or findings from a specific artifact,
place an [ARTIFACT:artifact_id] marker inline. These become footnotes linking to the artifact's code
in the GitHub repository (first mention gets a footnote with URL, subsequent mentions are omitted).
Use the exact artifact ID from <all_artifacts>. Place the marker right after the claim it supports.
Example:
  "Our evaluation showed a 15% improvement over baselines [ARTIFACT:art_4f9d2c81ab37]." 
TODO 4. WRITE PAPER: Write the full paper text with [FIGURE:fig_id] markers per <figure_instructions>,
and provide the figure specs in the figures array. Cite with numeric references [1], [2], etc.
At the end of the paper text, include a full bibliography section. Do NOT compile LaTeX or generate
actual image/figure files. Your ONLY output is the structured JSON.
</todos><user_data>

### Goal

Develop a new clustering-based method for organising sparse autoencoder (SAE) activations from large language models into more reliable units of analysis than individual latents.

### Reviewer Scope

Limit the technical core to areas the reviewer can deeply evaluate. Other fields are welcome for inspiration but should not host the substantive contribution.

Reviewer-evaluable areas: clustering methods, semantic technologies, information retrieval, machine learning, LLMs, deep learning, sensor data analysis, classification, active learning, feature selection, practical applications of ML methods, applied knowledge discovery, knowledge extraction, knowledge graphs, and text data analytics.

Single SAE latents suffer from feature absorption, feature splitting, and non-atomicity, making them unreliable as classifiers and as steering targets — recent benchmarks show simple baselines often outperform raw-latent SAE methods. Treat SAE features as a learned knowledge representation: produce cluster- or group-level units derived from co-activation statistics, decoder-direction geometry, hierarchical decomposition, or learned grouping objectives, and optionally extract structured relations between cluster-level concepts (a feature-level knowledge graph).

Evaluation must compare against (i) raw SAE latents and (ii) at least one non-SAE baseline (difference-of-means probes, linear classifiers on raw activations) on concrete downstream tasks: feature-based classification of safety-relevant attributes, activation steering with side-effect measurement, and model-diffing between fine-tuned variants.

Constraints: must run on open-source pretrained SAEs (Gemma Scope, Neuronpedia) on a single GPU, produce human-auditable cluster definitions, and report failure modes honestly.

### Publication

Target ICLR primary, ICML fallback.

### Things to Avoid

Theoretical results in computational learning theory (generalisation bounds, sample complexity, convergence proofs). The contribution must be a method or empirical finding, not a theorem.

description: Academic paper writing guidance for AI research. Covers paper structure, figure placeholders, bibliography building with Semantic Scholar, and citation rules. Does NOT cover LaTeX compilation or figure file generation — see aii-paper-to-latex for that.

## Technical Papers

Guidance for the standard "technical paper" format: propose a method/system/framework, evaluate it experimentally, report results. This is the main track at most CS venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, AAAI, etc.). Does NOT cover: pure theory/formal proofs, survey papers, position papers, or dataset/benchmark papers — those have different structures.

### Paper Structure

Target 6-8 pages. Use formal academic language, third person. Support claims with evidence from artifacts.

#### Rough Page Budget (8-page paper)

| Section | Pages | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Abstract | 0.3 | Problem, approach, key result |
| Introduction | 1.0-1.5 | The most important section |
| Related Work | 0.5-1.0 | Beginning or end (see below) |
| Methods | 1.5-2.0 | Architecture fig on page 1 |
| Experiments | 1.5-2.0 | Setup + results + ablations |
| Discussion | 0.5-1.0 | Limitations go here |
| Conclusion | 0.3-0.5 | Do not repeat the abstract |
| References | 0.5-1.0 | Not counted in page limit |

**Critical rule**: A clear new technical contribution must be articulated by page 3 (quarter of the paper). If the reader doesn't know what you did by then, you've lost them.

#### Section Details

**Abstract** (150-250 words): State the problem, your approach, and the main results. Be factual and comprehensive. Do not repeat the abstract word-for-word later in the paper.

**Introduction** — Follow this 5-paragraph structure:

1. **What is the problem?** Define the task concretely.
2. **Why is it interesting and important?** Real-world impact, scale.
3. **Why is it hard?** Why do naive approaches fail?
4. **Why hasn't it been solved before?** What's wrong with prior solutions? How does yours differ?
5. **What are the key components of your approach and results?** Include specific limitations.

End with a "Summary of Contributions" subsection — bullet list of contributions with section references. This doubles as an outline, saving space.

**Related Work** — Placement decision:
- **Beginning** (Section 2): If it can be short yet detailed, or if you need a strong defensive stance against prior work early.
- **End** (before Conclusions): If comparisons require your technical content, or if it can be summarized briefly in the Introduction. Can be titled "Discussion and Related Work."

**Methods/Approach**: Every section tells a story — the story of the results, NOT the story of how you arrived at them. Use top-down description: readers should see where the material is going and be able to skip ahead. Move gory details to appendices.

**Experiments**: Setup (datasets, metrics, baselines) → main results → ablations → analysis. Every claim needs quantitative evidence.

**Discussion**: Interpret results, compare to prior work, state limitations honestly. Limitations should be specific and actionable, not vague disclaimers.

**Conclusion**: Short summarizing paragraph. Do NOT repeat material from the Abstract or Introduction. Make original claims more concrete (e.g., reference quantitative results). Include future work as bullet list — if actively pursuing follow-up, say so to mark territory.

#### Writing Quality Rules

- Define all notation/terminology before use, only once. Group global definitions in Preliminaries.
- Do NOT use nonreferential "this", "that", "these", "it". Always specify the referent. BAD: "This is important because..." GOOD: "This accuracy gap is important because..."
- Do NOT use "etc." unless remaining items are completely obvious. BAD: "We measure volatility, scalability, etc." GOOD: "We measure volatility and scalability."
- Do NOT write "for various reasons" — state the actual reasons.
- "That" is defining, "which" is nondefining. "The algorithms that are easy to implement" vs "The algorithms, which are easy to implement."
- Use italics for definitions and quotes, not for emphasis. Context alone should provide emphasis.

### Figure Format

Figures use a hybrid marker + structured array approach. ALL figures are generated by a separate pipeline step using an AI image model — your `image_gen_detailed_description` is the ONLY input that model sees. It cannot read files or access data. Do NOT generate actual image files yourself (no matplotlib, no PIL, no image generation scripts).

**In paper_text**: Place `[FIGURE:fig_id]` markers where figures should appear.

**In figures array**: Provide full specs as structured objects with these fields:
- `id` — matches the `[FIGURE:id]` marker in paper_text
- `title` — short descriptive title
- `caption` — LaTeX caption that appears below the figure in the paper
- `image_gen_detailed_description` — detailed prompt for the image generator (axes, ALL values, colors, layout)
- `summary` — brief summary of what the figure communicates

Example in paper_text:
```
...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.

[FIGURE:fig_1]

The results in Figure 1 demonstrate...
```

Example figure spec in figures array:
```json
{"id": "fig_1", "title": "Performance Comparison", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers on JOB benchmark. RLQOpt achieves 2.3x speedup over PostgreSQL.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: accuracy (0.0-1.0). Values: ModelA=0.847, ModelB=0.762, Baseline=0.531. Error bars with std: 0.02, 0.03, 0.05. Sans-serif font, white background.", "summary": "Compares accuracy of proposed methods vs baseline."}
```

Every marker in text MUST have a matching figure in the array, and vice versa.

#### Data Precision Requirement

`image_gen_detailed_description` MUST include exact numbers from artifact output files. Read the actual output files before writing figure specs.

- BAD: "Compare accuracy metrics across configurations"
- GOOD: "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: accuracy (0.0-1.0). Values: K=3: 0.765, K=5: 0.729, Baseline: 0.121."

#### Figure vs Table Decision

Do NOT create figures for tabular data (rows/columns of text or numbers). Use `\begin{table}` in LaTeX instead. Figures are for actual visualizations only (charts, plots, diagrams).

#### Figure Placement Strategy

Be intentional with figure ordering. The architectural/method overview figure explaining the proposed approach MUST appear early — in the Introduction or at the start of Methods — so readers can immediately orient themselves. Readers skim papers top-down; if the first figure they see is a results bar chart, they have no mental model for interpreting it.

Recommended ordering:
1. **Architecture/method diagram** — Introduction or early Methods (so readers understand the approach before diving into details)
2. **Conceptual/analogy figures** — Introduction or Methods (to build intuition)
3. **Results figures** (bar charts, line plots, scatter plots) — Results section
4. **Analysis/ablation figures** — Discussion or later Results

#### Guidelines

- Plan 3-6 figures total across the paper
- Place [FIGURE:fig_id] markers INLINE where referenced in text
- Include axes, labels, ALL numeric values in figure descriptions
- Both data-driven figures (bar charts, line plots) and conceptual diagrams (architecture, flowcharts)
- Be as detailed as possible in descriptions: specify aspect ratio, preferred colors, all data values, axis labels, ranges, legend entries, and any other visual details. The more specific the description, the better the generated figure

### Bibliography with Semantic Scholar

Build `./references.bib` using the aii-semscholar-bib skill (real BibTeX from Semantic Scholar):

1. Collect DOIs, ArXiv IDs, or titles for all papers you need to cite
2. Call `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with the full list in one batch
3. Write the returned .bib text into `./references.bib`

Rules:
- Do NOT fabricate BibTeX entries — always fetch from Semantic Scholar
- If a paper isn't found (very recent preprint), write the entry manually as fallback
- Use `\bibliography{references}` and `\bibliographystyle{plainnat}`
- Do NOT use inline `thebibliography` environment

### Citation Format (for Research Artifacts)

When writing research with numbered citations:

1. Every factual claim MUST have a numbered citation: `[1]`, `[2]`, `[1, 3]`, etc.
2. Each source in the "sources" array MUST have an "index" field
3. The index MUST EXACTLY MATCH citation numbers in the text
4. NEVER cite a number without a matching source index
5. Example: "LLMs show 40% improvement with multi-agent collaboration [1]."

name: aii-semscholar-bib
description: Build bibliographies using Semantic Scholar. Batch-fetch BibTeX for papers by DOI, ArXiv ID, or title. Use when writing papers, generating reference lists, or building .bib files.
---

## Tool: `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch`

Batch-fetch BibTeX entries from Semantic Scholar. Pass all references in a single call — the tool handles batching internally.

### How it works

1. **DOI/ArXiv refs** → batched into POST /paper/batch calls (up to 500 per API call, auto-chunked)
2. **Title-only refs** → individual GET /paper/search/match (1s delay between)
3. **Post-process** → fix entry type, fix citation key (AuthorYYYY), inject DOI

The ability server runs a single worker (`max_threads: 1`). Multiple concurrent tool calls are queued — each runs independently (no cross-request aggregation). Batching happens within each request.

### Input format

```json
{
  "references": [
    {"doi": "10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762", "author": "Vaswani", "year": 2017},
    {"arxiv": "2201.11903", "author": "Wei", "year": 2022},
    {"title": "Tree of Thoughts", "author": "Yao", "year": 2023}
  ]
}
```

Each reference object can have:
- `doi` — DOI string (ArXiv DOIs like `10.48550/arXiv.XXXX.XXXXX` auto-convert to ArXiv IDs)
- `arxiv` — ArXiv ID (e.g. `"2305.14325"`)
- `title` — Paper title (used for search/match when no DOI/ArXiv)
- `author` — First author last name (for cleaner citation key)
- `year` — Publication year (int, for citation key)

At least one of `doi`, `arxiv`, or `title` is required per reference.

### Output format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "bib_text": "@inproceedings{Vaswani2017, ...}\n\n@article{Wei2022, ...}",
  "total": 3,
  "found": 3,
  "failed_count": 0,
  "entries": [{"citation_key": "Vaswani2017", "bibtex": "...", "title": "...", "doi": "...", "arxiv": ""}],
  "failed": []
}
```

### Workflow

1. Collect DOIs, ArXiv IDs, or titles for all papers you need to cite
2. Call `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with the full list in **one call**
3. Save `bib_text` from the response to your `references.bib` file
4. Check `failed` — for any missed papers, follow the **fallback procedure** below

### Fallback for failed references (MANDATORY)

NEVER fabricate BibTeX. For each failed reference:
1. **WebSearch** for `"Title" author year` (try `site:arxiv.org` too)
2. **WebFetch** the paper page → extract title, authors, year, venue, DOI/ArXiv ID
3. If DOI/ArXiv found → retry `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with it
4. Last resort: write BibTeX by hand using **only verified info from the actual paper page**

### CLI (for manual use / debugging)

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-semscholar-bib" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_semscholar_bib__fetch.py --refs '[
  {"doi": "10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762", "author": "Vaswani", "year": 2017},
  {"arxiv": "2201.11903", "author": "Wei", "year": 2022},
  {"title": "Tree of Thoughts", "author": "Yao", "year": 2023}
]'
```

`--json, -j` — output raw JSON instead of .bib text

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```
